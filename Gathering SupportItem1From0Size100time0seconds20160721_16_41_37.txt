Have tea and crumpets with the&nbsp;hilarious Mad Hatter. Endure insanity as you (try) to play hide-and-seek with the sneaky Cheshire Cat. Look! The March Hare is here as well! (Although I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s just a man in a bunny suit.) Wait, stop. Is that the villainous&nbsp;Queen of Hearts&nbsp;and some of her evil henchmen? (Is it her unbirthday?) Holy fat cats, Wonderland just got a little more mad than it already was! (No offense to you, Cheshire.)&nbsp;Become a part of the color and fun at this (apparently more than) Mad Tea Party, or it&#39;s off with your heads!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ever&nbsp;since I watched the old (and new) movie/s, I have been&nbsp;crazy about&nbsp;Wonderland!&nbsp;No pun&nbsp;intended. Well, it was sort of intended. The new remakes 2015-2016 were amazing, and they have become extremely popular!&nbsp;Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t seen one LEGO Set out there that seems even&nbsp;remotely related to Alice in Wonderland. Maybe they&#39;re out there,&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure. But&nbsp;they&#39;re not in&nbsp;any&nbsp;stores near me. This is why I strongly believe this LEGO Set is a perfect idea, and it sorely needs to be in LEGO stores. Although this set may not be this&nbsp;awesome building or some gigantic set that everybody wants, I can see a little girl or boy playing with their friends making up some ridiculous story line about this (more than) mad Tea Party. This set is not straight out of the movie, and that&#39;s what makes it (somewhat) unique, but of course it&#39;s just a generic idea. I have enormous&nbsp;flowers:&nbsp;a rose, a&nbsp;sunflower, and a lotus flower. I also have giant mushrooms, and each one has it&#39;s own color. The Cheshire Cat has his own, special tree, and there is also a doorway where Alice arrives from. I have the Queen of Hearts&nbsp;riding high on her horse, with red carpet under her. The poor soul behind her is rolling up the red carpet as the Queen&nbsp;goes along. Of course we have the actual table and&nbsp;chairs where the Mad Hatter and the March Hare (99% sure he&#39;s just a man in a bunny suit) sit. All these items can be found in the pictures above. There are 587 bricks. Even if you may not see yourself getting this set, or&nbsp;you&nbsp;simply just don&#39;t like it, support it anyway. Why? Think not of only yourself, but others.&nbsp;Maybe you have a younger sibling who likes Wonderland as much as I do. This set can be a nice present, whether it&#39;s for a birthday or Christmas. Think of even&nbsp;strangers! You may not like this set, but others who support me do! This LEGO Set can&#39;t&nbsp;get to stores if I don&#39;t get the !0,000 votes, so I need your help! Support it!

Headquarters), including characters such as Jimmy Olsen, Red Tornado, Indigo/Brainiac 8, Non and Maxwell Lord, however assumed many fans would like to receive &lsquo;classic&rsquo; variations of such figures before these CW &lsquo;variants&rsquo;.&nbsp; I also heavily considered including the show&rsquo;s unique incarnation of Martian Manhunter (/Hank Henshaw), however thought my set may then appear too similar to LEGO&rsquo;s 76040 Brainiac Attack, and given the choice of my inspiration of the S01E18 <em>&lsquo;Worlds Finest&rsquo; </em>scene, would not be show-accurate (though I&rsquo;d still love to see him produced in an accompanying polybag set, such as the official LEGO 30603 Batman Classic TV Series &ndash; Mr. Freeze).&nbsp; Original characters such as Winn Schott Jr, Astra In-Ze and Alex Danvers were omitted due assumed preference of original comic characters and likely a general lack of interest from potential consumers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Originally, I planned for the set to also include a NCFD Fire Engine, however quickly abandoned that idea, to reduce the set&rsquo;s piece count and keep the set at a largely affordable price, instead including a newly designed fire hydrant as a placeholder.</li>\r\n\t<li>The set is specifically designed so that it can easily be integrated into other LEGO sets and themes for maximum creativity and playability, especially LEGO City and other Super Heroes sets.</li>\r\n\t<li>Please note I have not included the necessary minifigure prints and piece decals on builds, especially the helicopter, in order for viewers to use their imagination and so as not to detract from my build.</li>\r\n\t<li>Note that due to LDD&rsquo;s issue with colouring the recently added dual-molded leg piece, both Supergirl and Silver Banshee&rsquo;s legs in the final images have rendered incorrectly, and are unable to be fixed.&nbsp; Supergirl is intended to have Dark Stone Grey upper legs and hips (representing her tights) and New Dark Red lower legs for her boots.&nbsp; Silver Banshee has Black upper legs and hips, and White boots.</li>\r\n\t<li>Regardless of the eventual result and eligibility of my project, I hope that this design inspires others to create their own models and designs, be it for&nbsp;<em>Supergirl </em>or any other project they wish to design and hope to come to fruition.&nbsp; If there is sufficient demand, I will upload the .lxf file online and link in the description for those who wish to make their own modifications or physically build the model.</li>\r\n\t<li>I&rsquo;m still only fairly new to the program LDD to POV-Ray Converter in order to render the final images, so any suggestions to improve quality (especially lighting) are definitely appreciated.</li>\r\n\t<li>Comments, suggestions and questions are welcome!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Coming Soon...&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The Flash</em>: <em>S.T.A.R.

Due to a grand supply of milk,&nbsp;and&nbsp;apparently a great demand, it was decided that milk would be the only beverage&nbsp;provided for the good people of Lego Town. (And of course water for the lactose&nbsp;intolerant).&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love old things, and I also love food,&nbsp;so I decided to combine the two into my very own LEGO Set! Without a doubt, this would make a great LEGO Set! I haven&#39;t seen many LEGO restaurants in stores. They&#39;re out there, but they&#39;re certainly not common. I&#39;ve decided to give LEGO another restaurant to place in their stores. The Old Quarter Inn has it&#39;s own unique style. It is my own unique design.&nbsp;It appears old and looks somewhat like an old European building, and yet it is a modern restaurant. The set comes with various LEGO figures. A cook, waiter, checkout guy, The Milker (she serves only milk and makes an exception for&nbsp;water for the lactose intolerant), and of course, the lovely customers. The staff are dressed in costumes to make the restaurant come to life. The customers also vary. There is the cute, young couple sitting outside under a parasol. Inside is the CowBar where a business woman sits with a computer, working, along with a man and a brief case. Upstairs is a few dining tables. An older couple are having a romantic dinner, and they are being asked by the waiter if they want milk or water (for the lactose intolerant). &nbsp;Also upstairs in the next room are a fun-filled family laughing it off waiting for their dinner. Now talking about physical features. There are 964 bricks.&nbsp;The roof is&nbsp;dark red with lights sitting on the side of the roof. There is a balcony&nbsp;for a couple who wants to be alone. Upstairs there are two joining rooms with an open archway. Inside one room is a booth and two small tables. Inside the other is two dining tables and little candles in the middle of each. Downstairs there is the kitchen with a little gate. Inside the kitchen is an oven with pizza in it, a stove top, and there is a little door leading outside. Also outside there is a menu right off the door.&nbsp;All of these items can be shown in the pictures above. Before this set can become an actual LEGO Set, I need your support. Making an account is free and easy to do! Tell your friends and family, and get them to tell their&nbsp;friends and family. Spread the word! Even if you don&#39;t really see yourself having this set, or maybe you don&#39;t like this set at all, support it anyway. Think of other people who would want this set in stores.&nbsp;If you do like it, by all means! Support it! If you can spend four hours playing video games, you can take ten minutes to create an account (don&#39;t worry it&#39;s free!) and support my LEGO Set.

I remember these cars buzzing about in big cities such as San Francisco in the 1960s. When you looked down from high-rise buildings, the streets appeared as if they were painted yellow with so many cabs. The classic rear fins along with the large hood and trunk were typical of cars of that day. Usually built with 8 cylinders, this Plymouth had great pick-up and go!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I built this model because, as a kid, I always wanted to build it with Lego pieces. I had plenty of versions of this car in my Hot Wheels and Matchbox car collections. But I never had the bricks to complete a Lego project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model will take adults back to their childhood or care-free days of the 1960s. Kids of today will be able to enjoy the retro look of the classic cars in the 1950s and 60s. They can also imagine what it would be like in the days of very large and roomy cars. And with new transportation options appearing every day like self-driving cars, the classic yellow taxi cab has become a nostalgic icon of public transportation. This model is something Lego and car enthusiasts will want on their shelves and Lego display cabinets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model can hold up to 4 minifigs! And all four doors open. The three minifigs in this set are the cab driver and a traveling couple on their vacation. Note that the husband doesn&#39;t look very happy as traveling can be both exciting and stressful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!

The Mystery Box is also used for storing small sweets inside. On the lid there is a handel where you can lift the lid from. It is built to help people find this to decorate with and store some items. It would make a great set because it helps people who have lots of stuff storing them. Hopefully you will really find this useful, fun to play with and having fun building. In this set there are 6 mini figures that are designed by me. There are some recycling stickers to stick on the sides. This is the Mystery Box! Hopefully you will like my project and support it!

This is the Workforce Around the World! It is a project dedicated to tradespeople all around the world! There are five work vehicles form 5 of the 7 continents. Antarctica was left out because they have no vehicles, and South America was left out due to not being able to find a reference photo. From left to right, there is a truck form Africa, a truck from North America, a truck from Asia, a truck from Australia, and a van from Europe. A few fellow Ideas members have been saying i only focus on US style builds. So that is how this creation all started. Fellow member Camshaft suggested this project as a solution. It can be quite educational for children too learn about other continents, countries, and cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The African work truck is green with black accents and tow mirrors. It has yellow and black warning stripes on the front bumper. In the bed, there is a water tank designed by the great Lightningtiger. Big thanks to him. The interior is basic with two black seats, speedometers,steering wheel, and a completed dash. It also has right hand steering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The North American work truck is red with light grey and black accents. It is a crew cab regular bed format. There is 4 black cupboards with grey doors and a ladder rack installed on the bed. The interior is basic with four black seats, a steering wheel, a set of speedometers, and a completed dash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Asian work truck is personally my favorite. It is yellow with black accents. It has a custom ladder rack mounted on the front and rear bumpers. The interior is really simple, with only a steering wheel, and no seats, but there will be an updated version soon. This model comes with right hand steering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Australian work truck is commonly called a Ute. It is white with black accents, and light grey bed. The front end was designed by LegoBricker. So big thanks to him. The bed has a ladder rack is &nbsp;installed into the bed. The rear bumper has a number plate on it. The interior is basic with two black seats, a steering wheel, a set of speedometers, and a completed dash. This truck also has right hand steering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European work van was suggested by fellow member CountBrickoski. It is a simple white panel van that is common in the Europe area. It is white with black accents and tow mirrors. The cabin doors and rear doors open. The van is in a medium length chassis with high roof set up. The interior has two black seats, a steering wheel, a set of speedometers, and a completed dash including one A/C vent. The cargo bay of the van has nothing in it. Tool boxes and other accessories can easily be added. On the roof, there is a ladder rack. This model features right hand steering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This set contains 726 bricks and would sell in the $75 to $100 US currency range. All models include ladders. All models also include mini figures in worker uniforms. You can keep the mini figure with their assigned vehicle, or mix and match them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you all for supporting this creation.

The choice to make exactly this model was inspired by the official set of Porsche GT3, but my way has been a bit different, as I wanted to make the car smaller.

Exactly this model could be a smaller collectible set for those who can&#39;t afford the exclusive GT3 or simply want another Porsche on their shelf. Of course, there is a lot of work to do and a huge gap between this concept and what the real sets look like (e.g. more efficient parts&#39;&nbsp;use, improved gearbox, a flat 6-engine at the back and other small&nbsp;details), but I&#39;m really interested in improving this model and will be extremely happy to see the dream come true.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feel free to vote for this project if you would like to - I&nbsp;will be very thankful to every single supporter! :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best wishes,&nbsp; _spacehopper_</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["porsche", "911", "technic", "gearbox", "car", "suspension", "red", "engine", "steering"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-19T07:17:53.000Z", "user": {"alias": "_spacehopper_", "id": 714614, "uuid": "6cf200ba-4261-4a8b-93ca-8cc094eb98a5"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "13", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "43", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-19T07:17:53.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 19, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/8f4/161/145279/2520489-o_1alsnpol6s5l6lbagpvv3190b7-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 12, "stats_views_count_short": "220"}, {"stats_days_left": 362.9780661101273, "updated_at": "2016-07-21T06:05:10.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/7c0/ea4/148012/2564301-o_1anv6dirt6u31dbj1rprgsn1hsi8-thumbnail.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 19, "published_at": "2016-07-19T07:09:59.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 6, "stats_comments_count_short": "7", "id": 148012, "user_id": 1110825, "uuid": "b229177f-d37d-43b7-b497-1bbc6f559674", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "The Jabberwocky", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 77, "body": "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One day, I was thinking of what I wanted to build.

NASA or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Yet in many cases, their contributions are&nbsp;unknown or under-appreciated &mdash; especially as women have historically struggled to gain acceptance in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\nThis proposed set celebrates five notable NASA pioneers and provides an educational building experience to help young ones and adults alike learn about the history of women in STEM. The five Women of NASA are:<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>Margaret Hamilton</strong>,<strong> </strong>computer scientist: While working at MIT under contract with NASA in the 1960s, Hamilton developed the on-board flight software for the Apollo missions to the moon. She is known for popularizing the modern concept of software.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>Katherine Johnson</strong>, mathematician and space scientist: A longtime NASA researcher, Johnson is best known for calculating and verifying trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo programs &mdash; including the Apollo 11 mission that first landed humans on the moon.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>Sally Ride</strong>, astronaut, physicist, and educator: A physicist by training, Ride became the first American woman in space in 1983. After retiring as a NASA astronaut, she founded an educational company focusing on encouraging children &mdash; especially girls &mdash; to pursue the sciences.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>Nancy Grace Roman</strong>, astronomer: One of the first female executives at NASA, Roman is known to many as the &quot;Mother of Hubble&quot; for her role in planning the Hubble Space Telescope. She also developed NASA&#39;s astronomy research program.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>Mae Jemison</strong>, astronaut, physician, and entrepreneur: Trained as a medical doctor, Jemison became the first African-American woman in space in 1992. After retiring from NASA, Jemison established a company that develops new technologies and encourages students in the sciences.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\nIn addition to a desktop frame that displays these five minifigures and their names, the set includes vignettes depicting: a famous photo of the reams of code that landed astronauts on the moon in 1969; instruments used to calculate and verify trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo missions; a microscale Hubble Space Telescope and display; and a mini space shuttle, complete with external tank and solid rocket boosters.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Thanks in advance for your support!

It was designed to plow through large obstructions and annihilate anything in its path.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Rebel Alliance's assault on Kamino in 1 BBY, Boba Fett was tasked with infiltrating the Rebel frigate Salvation. Acting under orders from Darth Vader, the bounty hunter was accompanied by a complement of specialized units, including terror troopers, specialized droids and the Terror Walker.\r\n\r\nThe Terror Walker was released onto the Salvation, and immediately began rampaging through the vessel, leveling all in its path. Its actions allowed companies of stormtroopers to access various areas of the ship and assist Boba Fett in his objective\u2014capturing Juno Eclipse.\r\n\r\nFett was ultimately successful; however, the arrival of General Rahm Kota and the clone of Galen Marek coincided with his mission, and the Terror Walker engaged Marek's clone in single combat in the ship's Core.\r\n\r\nThe Terror Walker fought against Marek's clone in the Salvation's reactor core, a battlefield that would bring about its end. Using the reactor itself to deactivate the Walker's shield, Marek was able to damage the Terror Walker and commandeer it.\r\n\r\nThe Terror Walker was rammed into the core, and proceeded to self-destruct. Its useless body was later utilized by the clone to escape the volatile area. Whatever remained of the droid was obliterated when the Salvation impacted into Timira City.\r\n\r\nThe set itself is actually very playable. Includes Marek Starkiller, The Terror Walker, and two terror droids.\r\n\r\nThat's the description, I hope you liked it and have supported.\r\n\r\n-Flowey", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["TFU", "II", "Marek", "Flowey"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-18T07:10:57.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Flowey", "id": 618240, "uuid": "14507b34-c140-4de5-9b58-abc493827095"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "7", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "18", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-18T07:10:57.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 18, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/e99/aff/144745/2510332-o_1aldegok99fh9143a9ea1q9ce-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 6, "stats_views_count_short": "159"}, {"stats_days_left": 361.9769875619213, "updated_at": "2016-07-21T06:05:08.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/641/d4f/146837/2545635-o_1an25uhv714elhfi1v81q8g15bf7-thumbnail-f9Sd5DlasXuFlA.png", "stats_supporters_count": 22, "published_at": "2016-07-18T07:08:26.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 12, "stats_comments_count_short": "7", "id": 146837, "user_id": 877811, "uuid": "4003acb5-e855-40c3-aafb-950e40873072", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Lego Bowling Alley", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 144, "body": "<p>No city is complete without a bowling alley, and this one is detailed to the last brick. &nbsp;The set comes with two staff and six guests (8 mini figures total) along with a bicycle, a motorcycle, and two cars. &nbsp;The building itself has parking for up to four cars and a sidewalk entrance with small gardens on either side. &nbsp;The roof of the structure is easily detachable and comes off as one large assembly. &nbsp;The building also has a hinged wall to open the build even more. &nbsp;Inside to bowling alley are two arcade cabinets, a check-in booth with shoe rack, shelves for bowling balls of various colors, and four lanes each with ten pins and blocks that can move up and down. &nbsp;The very back of the building is empty for a reason;

As in the original set I designed three different types of building. In main image I deliberately joined the 3 projects to give an idea of how are stylish and harmonious in a city context. The order of the images is from left to right and from top to bottom. As shown in the first picture, my design integrates seamlessly with the Corner Deli. The first building (photo from 2 to 11) is the Corner Ice Cream Shop, Fruit and Vegetables Stand. The structure is a two storey corner building composed by 520 bricks. The ground floor consists of the ice-cream parlor, from the corner where you can taste an ice cream sitting comfortably under a pretty tree and from a Vegetables small Shop. On the second floor there is an elegant living room with fireplace. <span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\"><span>The roof</span> <span>is a</span> <span>panoramic terrace</span></span>. Looking at all the images, you can see all the details that I embedded in this project. For example, at the lower floor you can see the inside of the Vegetables Store with scales and cash, while in the opposite part dedicated to Ice-cream Shop you may notice a showcase with ice cream. The colors I used are simple and quite common. The second project (picture from 12 to 19) is a Seedlings Store consists of 328 bricks. The ground floor is composed by the shop and the apartment&#39;s kitchen. Over the kitchen there is the bedroom. The roof can be removed to watch the room from above. The last construction (picture from 20 to 24) is a 2 storey small palace with corner for grilling, consisting of 268 bricks.<span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\"><span> Opening the</span> <span>little building</span> <span>you may notice</span> <span>that</span> <span>the interior</span> <span>is composed as follows</span><span>: &quot;Tiny lounge</span> <span>in the</span> <span>lower floor</span><span>, bedroom</span> <span>upstairs&quot;.

I also wanted to&nbsp;use some warning tiles on something small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think this set would go nicely with a space station or in your lego city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is my first project so please support it ;)&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["space", "launchpad"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-18T06:48:46.000Z", "user": {"alias": "legolife5449", "id": 1106149, "uuid": "26dd90cd-ef6b-4bb0-aa81-795bbe30d5eb"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "6", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "8", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-18T06:48:46.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 18, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/7b6/ae7/147758/2560471-o_1ano1jaikl0r1fi93o586e1fda7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 4, "stats_views_count_short": "35"}, {"stats_days_left": 361.9610482813426, "updated_at": "2016-07-21T06:05:10.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/2ab/2ac/147794/2561209-o_1anotbao6cu9k06pp71kmc1qht7-thumbnail-PjVX7ZadYFSqgQ.JPG", "stats_supporters_count": 24, "published_at": "2016-07-18T06:45:29.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 10, "stats_comments_count_short": "12", "id": 147794, "user_id": 228299, "uuid": "42f68dbb-5d2e-4a51-96a5-8b4cb397fd66", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Ergomatic Truck", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 106, "body": "<p>Time ago I have been asked to build a model of some Ergomatic Truck.

I know playability is a major factor but I got nostalgic and old LEGO space sets were amazing and the only thing it really mattered was that I could imagine it crossing the stars!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final Price:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s for you to speculate and LEGO to determine but I think a 50&euro; is a reasonable price given the number of bricks and the selection of pieces you get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope you like this and PLEEEASE check my other projects!

The spiked wheels and intimidating machine gun can put anyone on edge, but its sleek and dark design give it a suave and manly feel. In addition the machine gun can detach using a variety of technic pieces&nbsp;and become a completely separate ship if so desired. Since the machine gunner steers the entire motorcycle, when the ship detaches, who will drive the rest of the motorcycle? Well, when the ship detaches, a hidden cockpit is revealed with steering wheel and computer face. In addition the lone rider has a side gun and front guns at his disposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Night-Cycle is not the only thing that comes in this set. Two identical flying motorcycles are an addition to this set as well as three minifigures. The two flying motorcycles are mostly composed of a main, classic motorcycle piece with guns and other accessories attached. There are two identical minifigures also that come with the set and are meant for the flying motorcycles. The last figure is meant for the Night-Cycle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Set Components</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Night-Cycle</li>\r\n\t<li>Ninja Minifigure&nbsp;(3x)</li>\r\n\t<li>Flying Motorcycle&nbsp;(2x)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Possible Set?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Night-Cycle set would make a good official LEGO set for a variety of reasons. It is both creative and unique, not to mention clever and well built. The technic pieces for the wheels and guns make it functional and stable for easy playing. The ship that comes off the motorcycle is easily detachable and easy to put back on. This set also could be easily incorporated into a LEGO theme or just be a stand alone set. That being said, this set could be pretty challenging for the young builder but easy and fun to play with otherwise. Happy building, and please support!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["night", "dark", "black", "motorcycle", "vehicle", "flying", "ship", "machine gun", "ninja", "minifigure", "classy", "large set", "skykor"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-15T14:19:37.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Skykor", "id": 917620, "uuid": "7452bbfc-7bbe-4a9b-ae3b-525020b49396"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "16", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "34", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-15T14:19:37.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 15, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/72c/ada/147657/2558935-o_1anlfkm3o1ial1678ka51m8kqb74q-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 13, "stats_views_count_short": "183"}, {"stats_days_left": 358.48626455206016, "updated_at": "2016-07-21T06:05:10.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/608/cb8/147614/2558170-o_1ankc5nci1m60tcl4qd1vttbns7-thumbnail-ZK8U1IBp187TnQ.png", "stats_supporters_count": 61, "published_at": "2016-07-14T19:21:48.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 20, "stats_comments_count_short": "53", "id": 147614, "user_id": 1059449, "uuid": "6f045642-adb7-4020-b9f5-ab77532a01b1", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Car Parking", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 524, "body": "<p>This is a Car Parking area with 11 cars to choose&nbsp;from&nbsp;when playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three different car designs (regular, convertible with roof down, and convertible with roof up), and the cars come in many different colors.
