THANK YOU =)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Released in 1968, &ldquo;Yellow Submarine&rdquo; is an animated musical fantasy film inspired by the music of the Beatles, arguably the greatest rock band of all time. This model is inspired by the iconic submarine from which the film (and associated soundtrack album) gets its title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Basic Info</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dimensions: Length 26 cm x Width 5.5 cm x Height (w/stand) 16 cm<br />\r\nNumber of Pieces: 409</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Model Description</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model was built using LEGO Digital Designer (LDD). It features a functioning propeller and rudder, as well as a set of periscopes that can rotate to different angular positions. Perhaps the funnest part of this model, however, is that the top cover of the chassis is removable to reveal a cockpit that fits all four minifig Beatles members. Note that Technic blocks with holes and transparent round 1x1 plates were used for the windows. It is difficult to tell from the digital renders, but through the windows you can see whether the vessel is occupied or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the submarine fits the minifigs nicely, I made the submarine much smaller than it would otherwise be if it were &ldquo;true&rdquo; minifig scale. In &ldquo;true&rdquo; minifig scale, the submarine would be considerably larger and would require many more pieces. At the current size and piece count, this is a very manageable sized model for play as well as display.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The custom minifigs of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr were based on their respective likenesses featured on the film poster / soundtrack cover. A few exceptions were made by necessity or by choice. For example, some colours were altered and colour schemes simplified due to limitations of LDD. George&#39;s longer hair reflects him during a different phase of the Beatles, but was used here to help distinguish him from the other three members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments, questions, and constructive feedback of this model is greatly appreciated.
