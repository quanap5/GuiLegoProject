Needless to say, the reviews have skyrocketed since its release in May. This project contains around 300 pieces, and you will see why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this project, I have&nbsp;put in every detail I could find from the game to put into this set. If you take a look at the first picture underneath the title screen, you will see that the project is based off of the first level of the game, where the player moves in with his mother. This is where the players start making videos and start gaining subscribers. In this photo, I have carefully added a closet for extra clothes, a few shelves, and the computer desk.&nbsp;The second picture shows both sides of the room, just to show you that I carefully put everything I could find together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At some point, the player would have to get a game console to play on the television. In the third picture, I built an LCD television that has a custom decal printed on, using a window piece as the television screen. (The same goes for the bed.) On the TV stand, there is&nbsp;a piece that can be used as a game controller, so the player would be able to play console games on the television, instead of the computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, at some point, the computer is going to break. Now, if you were the player, who would you call to fix it? That&#39;s right, you would have to call the repair man, who can be seen in the fourth picture. This photo also features the computer desk with the swivel chair which I built using just four pieces. You can use the repair man to fix the computer whenever it breaks down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let&#39;s take a look at the minifigures who will be featured in this project. We have the repair man, the mother, the Youtuber (You can name him whatever you want in the comments if you wish), and two of the Youtuber&#39;s friends, Jack and Jenna. These minifigures can be seen in the last photo. I tried to get every little detail on these minifigures as I did for the entire room itself. However, projects have their flaws, meaning that this project is gonna be updated once in a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please support this project so that it becomes an official LEGO product. I have worked on this project for a whole month, and I would not want it to go to waste from here. There will be updates for this project, so be sure to check back here to see if one has shown. Until the update, thank you for reading, and I hope you support!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["youtube", "game", "pewdiepie", "jacksepticeye", "tycoon", "simulator", "sims", "thesims"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-11T12:54:40.000Z", "user": {"alias": "spiderninja101", "id": 647053, "uuid": "267e11ca-cebf-48e4-b7ac-8daabbdf76d5"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "3", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "4", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-11T12:54:40.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 11, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/22d/966/146905/2552725-o_1ancumvlj1sco1e091bd0l5atb7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 3, "stats_views_count_short": "23"}, {"stats_days_left": 364.94332398467594, "updated_at": "2016-07-11T12:53:55.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/256/44b/147141/2550456-o_1an8t9uc31nas19891ei2b181tj77-thumbnail-S81k_bAIhp39rA.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 4, "published_at": "2016-07-11T12:53:55.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 3, "stats_comments_count_short": "4", "id": 147141, "user_id": 593307, "uuid": "1f8fc371-0170-47c3-ad4f-fa809b0eea49", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Alice in Wonderland: One Golden Afternoon", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 9, "body": "<p>On a golden afternoon, young Alice follows a White Rabbit, who disappears down a nearby rabbit hole.

There is a Jurassic World logo on each door.&nbsp;The front grille has the bullbar bumper, and features the Mercedes logo. The rear of the car has a spare tire affixed to the back hatch. The roof and side windows also come off to access the interior.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since in LDD you cannot put decals on dinosaurs, I didn&#39;t add any, but in my mind this set would come with a guard minifig and a velociraptor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any feedback is much appreciated!

The crystals are mined from the mountains by a miner. A scientist then inserts it into the generator, and it starts to suck the power from it. The power goes through the generator and into the launcher. Another scientist checks over the generator, making sure everything is working, and one more locks the target and presses the button that makes the bomb go. A maintenance man fixes any issues with his tools and two guards protect the generator from peeking eyes. A security camera atop a mound of rocks watches over the whole thing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The set includes 7 minifigures and around 20 accessories. It comes with about 10 crystals.

Here, we can get a peek at the lives of such Jedi as Ki-Adi-Mundi, Ahsoka Tano, and more. Shall we take a look?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ki-Adi-Mundi&rsquo;s dorm: A wise Cerean Jedi, and part of the Jedi Council, Mundi would no doubt need his own place of rest and meditation. In his dorm, you see a bed, two weapons on display, a jar, and a meditation pool. The meditation pool was customized to Mundi&#39;s noble desires. Behind him is a little pump that drips a drop of water a minute. He does so because each drop of water reminds him of a Jedi that fell in battle, which were many in the Clone Wars (<a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ki-Adi-Mundi\">http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ki-Adi-Mundi</a> , Personality and Traits). Also, there is a place to put his lightsaber. For his lightsaber crystal, he uses a traditional Kasha crystal, a force enhanced crystal that was used as a tool for meditation by the Cerean people. He uses the crystal to help him clear his mind, both in meditation, and in battle. (Mundi would come with a blue blade to add to his hilt.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aayla Secura&#39;s dorm: In it are four pieces of furniture: two lamps, one bed, and one table. On the table is a computer and a holo-disc. She has no real bed, but instead sleeps on a cushion (green plate piece) with an extra-cushioned pillow. (Secura would come with two lightsabers, one green, and the other blue.)<br />\r\n&nbsp;To produce the lighting effect, the white pieces in the lamps glow in the dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahsoka Tano&rsquo;s dorm: Although the last episode of Clone Wars, Season 5 had Ahsoka moving out, I still think that people would be interested in this dorm. She has a bed, a table, a droid repair platform, and a computer for research. Her drive to become more like her master, Anakin, has led her to practice repairing droids,&nbsp;to help her understand how Anakin thinks.&nbsp;Her bed has no mattress, but still has a pillow. (Ahsoka would come with both of her lightsaber, one green, the other a yellowish-green.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mace Windu&rsquo;s dorm: Mace Windu doesn&#39;t ask for much. He has a large, round chair, a bed, a desk chair and a desk. On the desk is a computer. The bed comes with a cushion, a pillow, and a blanket. Right now, you can see him meditating on the chair. (Mace would come with his purple lightsaber.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those are all the dorms. Outside each dorm you can see a hall. Here, you can see that they can be connected, allowing a long line of dorms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the Temple, there are many other Jedi who have their own dorms. How about a place for Jocasta Nu, the librarian? Maybe she&#39;d have a computer, and a series of bookshelves for reading? Maybe she&#39;d even take a Holocron to seek knowledge from past Jedi. How about Gungi, the Wookie Padawan that travelled to Ilum with Ahsoka and other Younglings to get their lightsaber crystals? How many artifacts would decorate his room, to help him feel at home? Or maybe you can introduce your own character, with their own style and culture? Whatever you do, the options are endless for this set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for viewing this set. I hope you enjoyed, and will check out my other sets. May the Force be with you.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Star Wars", "Jedi", "Temple"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-11T06:21:56.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Xendor", "id": 247959, "uuid": "4b3bc6ac-ceb6-4dab-bd55-2f1737a46452"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "4", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "5", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-11T06:21:56.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 11, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/ce4/289/147116/2550116-o_1an8hipqtkcgj45khi9dq1j1ne-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 3, "stats_views_count_short": "53"}, {"stats_days_left": 364.67061422575233, "updated_at": "2016-07-11T06:21:13.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/c05/0e4/147122/2550199-o_1an8jvib217qvg963b21djks1a9-thumbnail-t5CQQrSZLkMwRQ.png", "stats_supporters_count": 10, "published_at": "2016-07-11T06:21:13.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 3, "stats_comments_count_short": "5", "id": 147122, "user_id": 1010810, "uuid": "e751f378-0d9f-4d36-b74f-bc1d66f99a0e", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Donuts!!!", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 43, "body": "<p>Hey guys!!

As always, remember to support and if you have any ideas to make this project better or suggestions for a future project, make sure to leave them in the comments!!&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["donuts", "donut", "pink", "maple", "bacon", "maple bacon", "blue", "berry", "blueberry", "glaze", "glazed", "frosting", "frosted", "sprinkles", "sprinkle", "sprinkled", "white", "red", "yellow", "green", "purple", "colorful", "rainbow", "rainbow sprinkles"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-11T06:21:13.000Z", "user": {"alias": "MattTheWaffleCat", "id": 1010810, "uuid": "c8cd3ec3-09cd-4ceb-8113-ad9863611be2"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "3", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "10", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-11T06:21:13.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 11, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/c05/0e4/147122/2550199-o_1an8jvib217qvg963b21djks1a9-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 5, "stats_views_count_short": "43"}, {"stats_days_left": 364.6680793870023, "updated_at": "2016-07-11T06:17:34.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/9cd/b53/147134/2550350-o_1an8prnfj6jd12cqngc1rp2nle-thumbnail-8NCzWd1nbQj7KQ.jpeg", "stats_supporters_count": 4, "published_at": "2016-07-11T06:17:34.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 4, "stats_comments_count_short": "3", "id": 147134, "user_id": 1108655, "uuid": "cabcc192-69ae-46c4-b836-6186c779e9b2", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "The Outhouse", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 12, "body": "<p><strong>No log cabin would be complete without the Outhouse!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can imagine yourself as Shrek from the movie&nbsp;<em>Shrek.</em>&nbsp;Open the door, step inside, and please don&#39;t forget to close it.
