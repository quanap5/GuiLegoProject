The single-engine fighter was the fastest and most versatile fighter in the fleet, but was lightly armed and armored. It does have a large fuel tank and powerful engine, plus twin blasters tipping the wings. The wing ends are also reinforced, so that only one extending landing gear leg (located under the main power converter) is necessary to land the craft and balance it perfectly on flat surfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The construction of the ship itself is quite unique, employing multiple advanced building techniques.

This theme is going to be extended into say one big set, one medium set and one small set (like how Lego do it now) which can give it a bit of a footprint on toy shelves (also there are some custom chest prints for the minifigures when they haven&#39;t got their chest armour on, this&#39;ll be posted later).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason why I think this would make a good Lego set would be because you don&#39;t see a lot of sets out there that are based upon mechs that have good articulation; this set does go back to having the &#39;clicky&#39; joints which were used in the old exo force sets (that was the main inspiration for this set).

The Luggage is a&nbsp;magical, bottomless travel accessory&nbsp;on hundreds of tiny pink legs given to Rincewind by a tourist named Twoflower. It is intensely protective and will protect its owner from anything, which has included sharks, demon kings, tribal sacrifice, and strange creatures from other dimensions with far to many limbs and tentacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some liberties have been taken with the building of the cart itself as it is never properly described in the books. Because of this, the general feel of Dibbler is what the cart was based off of when it was designed. Complete with roasting&nbsp;rat, moldy sausage, flavour disguising condiments,&nbsp;and decaying canopy, the cart would be a fantastic play piece. Also, Dibbler comes with the ingredients that he uses to make his sausages.

My megazord design features a full accurate transformation to the original megazord design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The megazord first appeared in season one of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers(1993) as the rangers main fighting mech. Given to the rangers by Zordon, the megazord was used to fight the giant monster minions of Rita Repulsa.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This easily recognizable and memorable design has always been my favorite. I have for a few years wanted to build a Lego megazord, It took me a few months to complete my design, and i feel happy with how it turned out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Features:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>5 zords (Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Mastodon, Saber tooth tiger, and Pterodactyl)</li>\r\n\t<li>Increased poseability, ratcheted knees, feet, and hips, ball joint shoulders, head swivel</li>\r\n\t<li>All zords have separate modes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be quite a few stickers on this design, in order to get an accurate appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The images of the separate zords are not rendered yet, It takes me a very long time to complete full sticker designs, they will look just like the toy stickers,&nbsp;i will work on those and add them later</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used BlueRender and Paint to create the main image</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope everyone likes my idea, please support, share, and always keep building</p>\r\n\r\n<p>thanks, TheHAWK1209</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["lego", "power rangers", "megazord", "vehicle", "mecha"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-27T07:30:25.000Z", "user": {"alias": "TheHAWK1209", "id": 941031, "uuid": "4ba1dc95-f3de-4bab-9edf-5b0d3a372326"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "10", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "26", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-27T07:30:25.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 27, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/2fb/89a/148902/2577589-o_1aol078o4aah1heueqp1sditnp7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 8, "stats_views_count_short": "180"}, {"stats_days_left": 363.56299454594904, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:14.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/631/f6a/148882/2577520-o_1aoklleocnmeu43p5i7puvfs7-thumbnail-BFqytGQAuZmyJQ.png", "stats_supporters_count": 10, "published_at": "2016-07-27T07:29:26.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 6, "stats_comments_count_short": "25", "id": 148882, "user_id": 593307, "uuid": "e614dee7-45cb-4cb7-b515-81c8ccaf39c9", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Girl Meets World: Apartment", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 100, "body": "<p>Riley is the daughter of Cory and Topanga and she goes to school with her friends Maya and Farkle and new person Lucas who Riley likes.

He either watches the drone in VLOS (Visual Line Of Sight) or uses a HUD (Heads Up Display) to see what the drones sees with its auxiliary camera. Either on his remote or the HUD, he cans also monitor relevant flight parameters (flight time, battery capacity, eventual warning and error messages, etc...)<br />\r\nThe photographer uses a remote control to set the camera heading, pitch and roll, and all other necessary camera parameters (focal length, sensitivity, diaphragm aperture, shutter speed, area of focus, etc...).
