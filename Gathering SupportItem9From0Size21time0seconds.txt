Here, we can get a peek at the lives of such Jedi as Ki-Adi-Mundi, Ahsoka Tano, and more. Shall we take a look?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ki-Adi-Mundi&rsquo;s dorm: A wise Cerean Jedi, and part of the Jedi Council, Mundi would no doubt need his own place of rest and meditation. In his dorm, you see a bed, two weapons on display, a jar, and a meditation pool. The meditation pool was customized to Mundi&#39;s noble desires. Behind him is a little pump that drips a drop of water a minute. He does so because each drop of water reminds him of a Jedi that fell in battle, which were many in the Clone Wars (<a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ki-Adi-Mundi\">http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ki-Adi-Mundi</a> , Personality and Traits). Also, there is a place to put his lightsaber. For his lightsaber crystal, he uses a traditional Kasha crystal, a force enhanced crystal that was used as a tool for meditation by the Cerean people. He uses the crystal to help him clear his mind, both in meditation, and in battle. (Mundi would come with a blue blade to add to his hilt.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aayla Secura&#39;s dorm: In it are four pieces of furniture: two lamps, one bed, and one table. On the table is a computer and a holo-disc. She has no real bed, but instead sleeps on a cushion (green plate piece) with an extra-cushioned pillow. (Secura would come with two lightsabers, one green, and the other blue.)<br />\r\n&nbsp;To produce the lighting effect, the white pieces in the lamps glow in the dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahsoka Tano&rsquo;s dorm: Although the last episode of Clone Wars, Season 5 had Ahsoka moving out, I still think that people would be interested in this dorm. She has a bed, a table, a droid repair platform, and a computer for research. Her drive to become more like her master, Anakin, has led her to practice repairing droids,&nbsp;to help her understand how Anakin thinks.&nbsp;Her bed has no mattress, but still has a pillow. (Ahsoka would come with both of her lightsaber, one green, the other a yellowish-green.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mace Windu&rsquo;s dorm: Mace Windu doesn&#39;t ask for much. He has a large, round chair, a bed, a desk chair and a desk. On the desk is a computer. The bed comes with a cushion, a pillow, and a blanket. Right now, you can see him meditating on the chair. (Mace would come with his purple lightsaber.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those are all the dorms. Outside each dorm you can see a hall. Here, you can see that they can be connected, allowing a long line of dorms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the Temple, there are many other Jedi who have their own dorms. How about a place for Jocasta Nu, the librarian? Maybe she&#39;d have a computer, and a series of bookshelves for reading? Maybe she&#39;d even take a Holocron to seek knowledge from past Jedi. How about Gungi, the Wookie Padawan that travelled to Ilum with Ahsoka and other Younglings to get their lightsaber crystals? How many artifacts would decorate his room, to help him feel at home? Or maybe you can introduce your own character, with their own style and culture? Whatever you do, the options are endless for this set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for viewing this set. I hope you enjoyed, and will check out my other sets. May the Force be with you.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Star Wars", "Jedi", "Temple"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-11T06:21:56.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Xendor", "id": 247959, "uuid": "4b3bc6ac-ceb6-4dab-bd55-2f1737a46452"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "1", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "1", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-11T06:21:56.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 11, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/ce4/289/147116/2550116-o_1an8hipqtkcgj45khi9dq1j1ne-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 0, "stats_views_count_short": "1"}, {"stats_days_left": 364.9955278112037, "updated_at": "2016-07-11T06:21:13.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/c05/0e4/147122/2550199-o_1an8jvib217qvg963b21djks1a9-thumbnail-t5CQQrSZLkMwRQ.png", "stats_supporters_count": 1, "published_at": "2016-07-11T06:21:13.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 1, "stats_comments_count_short": 0, "id": 147122, "user_id": 1010810, "uuid": "e751f378-0d9f-4d36-b74f-bc1d66f99a0e", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Donuts!!!", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 1, "body": "<p>Hey guys!!

They had gone up there&nbsp;Looking for their friend Boot, who was searching for an old treasure that was hidden there many years before. Little did they know, they had walked right into and ambush! Humongous venooses (Giant twelve legged arachnids) repelled from the attic rafters, surrounding the group of friends.&nbsp;Soon after a gigantic silvery venoos caught Dilly with a line of thick sticky webbing. Dod tried throwing gold coins at the beast, but it did not back down. It just kept pulling Dilly closer until she was only a few feet from&nbsp;its huge fangs. Dod tried hopelessly to free her, but with nothing to sever the line with, his efforts were in vain. But then, when Dod was about to give up, Boot charged out of the shadows (Wearing an old suit of armor) and slayed the Silvery venoos. He then threw a pile of rotten bones in the remaining venooses&#39; direction, this kept their attention long enough for the threesome to make their escape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SET INCLUDES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Detailed attic wall and connecting rafters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Fully pose-able giant silvery venoos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. two pose-able venooses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.

His company (&ldquo;<strong>Lazareth</strong>&rdquo;) is based in Annecy, a beautiful little town located in the French Alps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of his last creation is called <strong>LM 847</strong> &hellip; If I had to chose just two words to describe Ludovic Lazareth&rsquo;s LM 847, I would probably say &ldquo;<em><strong>Beautiful Beast</strong></em>&rdquo;. LM 847 is indeed a motorcycle (yes it is !) with four independent wheels and powered by the 4.7-liter, 32-valve V8 Maserati engine !! This amazing engine unleaches no less than 470 horsepower &hellip; that&rsquo;s probably the reason why Ludovic Lazareth made the choice to transplant two huge tires on the back of his LM 847. Each rear wheel is connected to the Maserati engine and is suspended independently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to this complex system, when one wheel moves up, the other one moves down, and this allows the bike to lean &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same two tires are found at the front end but this time the system is more complex. Indeed, as for the rear part, the two wheels have to move independently and must also include the steering system !!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between the front and rear wheels, the monstrous engine, a wide handlebar and a tail section sampled from a Ducati Panigale &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This &ldquo;bike&rdquo; is just amazing and I decided to build a LEGO version about three months ago !</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding how the front and rear suspensions worked and building this set with features as close as possible to the real LM 847 <strong>was a big challenge !</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, three months later, here is my LM 847 :</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>V8 working engine connected to the two independent rear wheels</li>\r\n\t<li>Front and rear tilting 2-wheel suspension</li>\r\n\t<li>Working steering system consisting of no less than 21 gear wheels</li>\r\n\t<li>Two independent front body panels</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I also built a bike lift tailored to the specific features of the LM 847. Two little wheels can move forward and contact the rear wheels in order to stabilize the bike. An M-motor can be connected to the bike lift and allows to see the V8 engine driving the wheels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I really hope you will enjoy and support my last project ! waiting for your comments !! ;) ;)</strong></p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["bike", "maserati", "engine", "wheels", "suspension", "ducati", "lazareth", "v8", "motorcycle", "motor", "steering", "stand", "technic", "m-motor", "power functions"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-09T21:59:15.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Vincentg007", "id": 1055198, "uuid": "b1e33e4c-dbf1-4b3d-b450-9a351381a145"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "20", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "47", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-09T21:59:15.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 09, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/d51/6e5/147033/2550054-o_1an8askst1cjs1om89t3154chmge-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 26, "stats_views_count_short": "188"}, {"stats_days_left": 363.64623222165505, "updated_at": "2016-07-11T06:03:53.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/8a2/713/147002/2548657-o_1an5v95ospnn1vjd1noj1eun18ml7-thumbnail-neV_8V6qVOI7hg.JPG", "stats_supporters_count": 8, "published_at": "2016-07-09T21:58:14.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 9, "stats_comments_count_short": "4", "id": 147002, "user_id": 1105720, "uuid": "578361fa-ccc9-4a43-a07b-906ecc13ba6b", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Dessert Scavengers Alliance Surveillance Probe", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 37, "body": "<p>When creating &nbsp;this set i kept in mind the things a small set can consist of.A very small set in very but also very different set.
