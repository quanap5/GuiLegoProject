One of the only two&nbsp;SuperSonic Transports to enter commercial service, the other being the Tu-144 Charger, the Concorde revolutionized trans-Atlantic travel and set several astonishing world&nbsp;speed records. This came at a cost however, as&nbsp;some serious noise pollution was created from the frequent breaking of the sound barrier. The Concorde was nevertheless one of the safest passenger aircraft, with only a single fatal accident in 2000&nbsp;which was due to debris on the runway. Finally, after almost 40 years of service, the Concorde&#39;s career came to an end in 2003, with all aircraft retiring from either British Airways or Air France service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the model:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve always wanted to build a Concorde!&nbsp;With so many small-scale models around and already one impressive large scale model by Ed Diment (Lego Monster), I felt it was time someone attempted a mid-scale version.

So what we are looking for in a set are the elements that are harder to organize and come by.  A few parts that have not been molded in the right colors, and of course a few figures.  <br><br>Just enough content to drop the TARDIS, the TARDIS console,  the Doctor, and his Companions into a build for a little flavor, and a few trouble makers to stir the pot.<br><br>We are suggesting 5 Minifigures, K-9, and 3 Brick Built Daleks for characters.  <br>For setting elements we are suggesting the TARDIS external (Police Box) and a TARDIS Console.<br><br>YOUR ROLE IN THIS<br>Remember how in \"The Year that Never Was\" Martha goes around the world telling everyone about the Doctor...and it is critical to saving everything!  Well, You are Martha in this scenario.  Vote for the project of course, and Vote for your favorite characters in our poll (see bellow) but most importantly, Spread the Word!!!  Tell every Whovian.
