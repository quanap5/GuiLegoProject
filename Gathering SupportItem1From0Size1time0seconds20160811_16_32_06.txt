This project is a tribute to the vivid imagination of kids everywhere who dream of travelling through space and exploring the universe...all from&nbsp;the backyard!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Basic Info</strong><br />\r\nRocket approximate dimensions: 22.5 cm (high) x 14.0 cm (wide)<br />\r\nRocket number of pieces: 298<br />\r\nProject number of pieces: 434</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Model Description</strong><br />\r\nThis project was created using LEGO Digital Designer (LDD), and&nbsp;comprises of&nbsp;a main rocket build, a mission control, as well as a tree. Unlike a real space rocket, this rocket was designed specifically to look like something built (with the help of adults of course) for play in a backyard. Some key features include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Large, hexagonal fuselage with removable top section</li>\r\n\t<li>Circular hatch reachable by wooden ladder (note the sign &ldquo;Warning: No Adults&rdquo;)</li>\r\n\t<li>Hand-drawn map of the solar system, controls, displays, and flashlight</li>\r\n\t<li>Windows and vents</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Mission&nbsp;control&nbsp;is set up&nbsp;next to&nbsp;Bruce&#39;s doghouse.&nbsp;Mission personnel and&nbsp;space travellers&nbsp;communicate via walkie-talkies, perhaps in between sips of slurpies. There&#39;s also a toolbox and a toy replica of the rocket beside the doghouse. Lastly, a medium-sized tree, with cats and a bird looking on, completes the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Minifigs</strong><br />\r\nThis project includes four kids minifigures with custom torso designs, as well as various accessories such as walkie-talkies, slurpies, and a skateboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments, questions, and constructive feedback of this&nbsp;project is greatly appreciated!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon&#39;t forget to check out my other LEGO Ideas projects!<br />\r\nFollow me on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/kevinszetolego<br />\r\nSee more Ideas and Non-Ideas images on my Flickr https://www.flickr.com/photos/dreamcatcher1979/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for viewing!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["kids", "space", "spaceship", "rocket", "engine", "planets", "stars", "backyard", "toy", "cats", "dogs"], "state_entered_at": "2016-08-11T06:50:16.000Z", "user": {"alias": "kevinszeto", "id": 581618, "uuid": "d0c6df0f-fc1d-4e3d-a802-d03e20648274"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "2", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "3", "support_ending_at": "2017-08-11T06:50:16.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Aug 11, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/e50/780/149516/2600578-o_1apq1rjg71akf1q5pl501s761ofp7-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 1, "stats_views_count_short": "5"}], "facets": {"tags": {"buckets": [{"key": "lego", "doc_count": 940}, {"key": "car", "doc_count": 567}, {"key": "space", "doc_count": 407}, {"key": "star wars", "doc_count": 359}, {"key": "city", "doc_count": 341}, {"key": "vehicle", "doc_count": 339}, {"key": "minifigure", "doc_count": 284}, {"key": "modular", "doc_count": 275}, {"key": "building", "doc_count": 263}, {"key": "cool", "doc_count": 236}], "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 37, "sum_other_doc_count": 56082}}, "total": 5570, "max_score": null}
