One of the only two&nbsp;SuperSonic Transports to enter commercial service, the other being the Tu-144 Charger, the Concorde revolutionized trans-Atlantic travel and set several astonishing world&nbsp;speed records. This came at a cost however, as&nbsp;some serious noise pollution was created from the frequent breaking of the sound barrier. The Concorde was nevertheless one of the safest passenger aircraft, with only a single fatal accident in 2000&nbsp;which was due to debris on the runway. Finally, after almost 40 years of service, the Concorde&#39;s career came to an end in 2003, with all aircraft retiring from either British Airways or Air France service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the model:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve always wanted to build a Concorde!&nbsp;With so many small-scale models around and already one impressive large scale model by Ed Diment (Lego Monster), I felt it was time someone attempted a mid-scale version.

So what we are looking for in a set are the elements that are harder to organize and come by.  A few parts that have not been molded in the right colors, and of course a few figures.  <br><br>Just enough content to drop the TARDIS, the TARDIS console,  the Doctor, and his Companions into a build for a little flavor, and a few trouble makers to stir the pot.<br><br>We are suggesting 5 Minifigures, K-9, and 3 Brick Built Daleks for characters.  <br>For setting elements we are suggesting the TARDIS external (Police Box) and a TARDIS Console.<br><br>YOUR ROLE IN THIS<br>Remember how in \"The Year that Never Was\" Martha goes around the world telling everyone about the Doctor...and it is critical to saving everything!  Well, You are Martha in this scenario.  Vote for the project of course, and Vote for your favorite characters in our poll (see bellow) but most importantly, Spread the Word!!!  Tell every Whovian.

My family and I are extreme Lego fans and when the Lego Disney Princess line of new sets that came out this past January were released, the first question my daughter had was &quot;Do they have a Frozen set with Elsa?&quot;. We quickly discovered to our surprise that Lego did not create one although I had to buy every single Disney Princess set that they did make for my daughter because they were awesome! As a couple weeks went by, I really felt that this was a missed opportunity by Lego and I really wanted to make my daughter&#39;s favorite part of the whole movie-The Ice Palace! I knew I couldn&#39;t cut corners, chince or go half way on this...it had to be awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/ef1/12d/390642/image\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I first started researching parts and colors to see if I could do justice to such an awesome structure with only Lego parts as a medium. After a lot of searching and learning new things about lego colors and parts, I felt I could move forward but it was not going to be easy. I found a lot of pieces I would need, came from some older sets from a few years ago and some new ones as well. It was one of the most fun, educational and fulfilling experiences I&#39;ve ever had in my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/245/998/389826/image\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is intended to fill a big void out there in what I feel is lacking a bit-the larger set/collectible girl Lego market. Let&#39;s face it though, both my boys and millions around the globe want an Ice Palace too! If Lego were to start producing some of these molds in mass again and change some of the colors of current pieces and/or accessories, I believe this set could easily be made at an affordable price point while still obtaining profit for Lego. There isn&#39;t a single piece I used that was not Lego made. Only things I made myself were Elsa&#39;s and Anna&#39;s capes. Only modifications I made were to paint the Lego Hero Factory joints white for the snow monster, paint Anna&#39;s hair with white stripe, as well as her shirt and skirt. I&#39;m not good with decal-making so I did cut out some eyes, a nose and decal hair and placed them all on a pure lego Olaf. That&#39;s it! All Lego! I tried making it as accurate to the movie as possible with some neat little surprises such as spiral staircase, chandelier, back doorway and staircase, ice bed, ice fountain and ice goblet &amp; pitcher! It even has the balcony where Elsa can go sing her now unforgettable song that is repeated by little girls and boys everywhere I go...&quot;Let it go!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/525/280/390633/image\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/1bf/541/390625/image\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for visiting my project page and if you like this project, then please sign up for a Cuusoo account and vote!

One things for sure...my kids love it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n***PROJECT GOAL DEADLINE !***<br />\r\nDUE TO LEGO TRANSITIONING THE CUUSOO PROGRAM OVER TO THE NEW LEGO IDEAS PROGRAM, WE NOW HAVE A DEADLINE OF MAY 1ST, 2015 TO REACH 10,000 SUPPORTS. PLEASE KEEP SHARING THE PROJECT!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n****tips for helping to get more votes****<br />\r\n-spread the word<br />\r\n-forward this page via e-mail, facebook sharing, twitter, Google plus, Flikr, Instagram, and Pinterest to everyone you know<br />\r\n-post a link in any social forums you frequent<br />\r\n-tell people about it in your daily trips anywhere you go<br />\r\n-post links to this page in Disney/Frozen and brick building forums<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFAQ:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy didn&#39;t you include classic minifigures instead of the Friends-style or &quot;girl figures&quot;?<br />\r\n- A lot of thought went into what the look of this set would be...including the minifigures. While the majority of Lego fans seem to be boys of all ages, it was a decision I made based on two main factors. First, this is something my daughter wanted and even though my boys saw the movie, they didn&#39;t think of this idea. They did however, love it in every way as I started designing and making it and even pushed me to include elements I didn&#39;t think of. Second reason is that it&#39;s seemingly obvious which minifigures Lego themselves would choose given the demographic of the movie&#39;s audience and their interests in the already existing Disney Princess license. Bottom line, I&#39;m a Lego fan and a Frozen fan. I&#39;m also a father and I built this palace the way I felt it should be introduced to the world for both girls and boys and if I saw this in any store, not having built my own of course, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to buy two of them-1 for my kids and 1 for display/collecting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhere&#39;s Kristoff and Sven?<br />\r\n- I didn&#39;t forget them! I was trying to get the Palace itself completed with quality in mind first and the minifigures/characters were second. I wanted to get a completed project out as soon as possible and always had adding Kristoff and Sven at a later time on my mind, if I could make them according to the standards they deserve. For those that haven&#39;t submitted their own projects, I highly recommend reading the terms and guidelines for submissions. Lego does not currently allow submissions with ideas for new molds or pieces of which I truly believe both Kristoff and Sven would need in order to be done right. I researched long and hard for existing Lego hairpieces, animal pieces to make these two awesome characters and came up short every time. Good news is that Lego has the power to create new molds and if they want to make a Frozen Lego set, they ultimately can make a headpiece for a horse to look like Sven or minifigure shoes that are pointed like Kristoff and have all the awesome details and paint added that would make them perfect. The point is to vote for this project either way! If Lego sees that the public has an interest in a Frozen Lego set, then they will make one!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you make Olaf look better?<br />\r\n-Again, Lego doesn&#39;t allow new piece ideas in Cuusoo submissions. Everything you submit has to be made from existing Lego pieces or just something that they can change color of themselves. I was hesitant to submit my project with Olaf the way I did and literally tried A LOT of different designs for snowmen before deciding on my final version of him. Ultimately I feel Olaf would best be completed by Lego with a new headpiece mold that Lego can create if they obtain the Frozen license. I envision it being something similar to the new Simpsons headpieces or any of the minifigure pieces that fit over standard minifig head pieces and Olaf would be alive. So think of my Olaf as a placeholder until Lego were to make a Frozen set themselves. If I go into photoshop and create the perfect Lego Olaf now, then Lego Cuusoo could very well disqualify my project and the dream of a Lego Frozen set could disappear with it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is for girls, why did you make this?<br />\r\n-Hey, hey now...girls love Lego too! This Ice Palace could easily be played with by boys and as a matter of fact, it already is...by my boys. My son may not use the doll figures as much but he uses his own &quot;boy&quot; minifigures to play with his sister and they have a blast. The movie resonates with people of both genders and it&#39;s success can attest to that. I know this question may come from the younger male fans but let&#39;s open our eyes to the bigger picture of the fact that we&#39;re getting a Frozen Ice Palace if this gets past a review with lego Cuusoo...you can always use whichever minifigures you want to play with because that&#39;s what Lego is all about!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLove it but why did you do this? Lego will probably make one of their own...<br />\r\n- Well, I made this because my daughter wanted a Lego Frozen Ice Palace, I didn&#39;t want her to have to wait, and I didn&#39;t want to wait a long time to have something come out in several months or later and not have it look like Elsa&#39;s actual Ice Palace. We love Lego in my household. We love what they do for children and the world, but even we know they can&#39;t get every design right all the time. I mean it when I say a lot of time and research was spent on piece color, molds, piece availability, cost and price and overall size and design of this set before bringing it to completion. I want this to be done correctly so I took matters into my own hands to hopefully guide Lego in what I felt was the right direction. I know everyone won&#39;t agree that my project, the colors used, the overall look,etc is what the definitive version should be and that&#39;s ok! I just wanted to get the ball rolling. If Lego releases an Ice Palace from Frozen because they have been working on it already in secret or they simply get it done before my project can reach 10,000 votes... I would still be excited to see what their masters can come up with!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan I post this project on my (any given webpage, social page,website) site?<br />\r\n-Yes! Please and by all means...thank you!!! All I ask is that you give credit for the project and pictures to Fohzen somewhere on your page along with a link back to the Lego Cuusoo site so viewers can support the project!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo you have higher resolution photos available for view?<br />\r\n-Yes! I have created a Flikr account under username Fohzen where you can see this project in higher resolutions. There&#39;s even a couple more pics that aren&#39;t posted here for viewing. Just keep in mind to refer people to this page and not the Flikr page when asking them to support the project!<br />\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/118455817@N08/<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you make other sets?<br />\r\n-This is my first experience with Lego Cuusoo. Thanks to Lego Cuusoo user buggyirk, it has been brought to my attention that I can submit numerous projects at one time! What this means is that I will certainly be brainstorming over the next few weeks/months as my main focus will be promoting Elsa&#39;s Ice Palace!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy did you use so many clear pieces/clear blue pieces of the same color? Why not add some solid colored pieces instead?<br />\r\n-Believe it or not, this model has a total of 6 different colors in it. I tried to remain respectful to Disney&#39;s design and look of the Ice Palace from the movie...which is mostly an ice-blue color. There are many scenes in the movie where lighting conditions from the sunsets/sunrises and change in Elsa&#39;s mood add some real nice purples, pinks and magenta colors. I did research into some other transparent lego pieces in these colors but none of them seemed to fit the needs of the project or were simply not the right molds for the job. If I can get my hands on some red or purple lit Lego bricks I might be able to test how that looks. We&#39;ll see!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n***UPDATES***<br />\r\n-250 votes achieved 2/26/14!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-500 votes achieved 3/4/14!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-1000 votes achieved 4/7/14!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/27/14 ACHIEVED TOP 10 MOST SUPPORTED PROJECTS OF THE WEEK-#2!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/22/14 FEATURED ON GIZMODIVA.COM-http://gizmodiva.com/other_stuff/lego-frozen-ice-palace.php<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/22/14 FEATURED ON RANDOMMIZATION.COM-http://randommization.com/2014/04/22/elsas-ice-palace-frozen-lego/<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/22/14 FEATURED ON TECHNABOB.COM-http://technabob.com/blog/2014/04/22/elsas-ice-palace-lego-set/<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/21/14 FEATURED ON NERDAPPROVED.COM-http://nerdapproved.com/toys/this-lego-frozen-ice-palace-looks-amazing/?tru=Fk2wo#CSy2y018dyrWJYst.99<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/20/14 FEATURED ON MCMBUZZ.COM-http://www.mcmbuzz.com/2014/04/20/frozen-lego-elsas-ice-palace-on-cuusoo/<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/20/14 ACHIEVED TOP 10 MOST SUPPORTED PROJECTS OF THE WEEK-#3!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/19/14 FEATURED ON THEMARYSUE.COM!-http://www.themarysue.com/things-we-saw-today-524/<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/19/14 FEATURED ON BRICKFANATICS.co.UK as CUUSOO pick of the week!-http://brickfanatics.co.uk/cuusoo-pick-23-elsas-ice-palace/<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/18/14 FEATURED ON TOPLESS ROBOT.COM!-http://www.toplessrobot.com/2014/04/i_love_this_proposed_lego_frozen_palace_and_wont_l.php<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/17/14 FEATURED ON LEGO.GIZMODO.COM!-http://lego.gizmodo.com/coolest-dad-ever-creates-elsas-ice-castle-from-frozen-1564273321<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/13/14 ACHIEVED TOP 10 MOST SUPPORTED PROJECTS OF THE WEEK-#8<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4/6/14-ACHIEVED TOP 10 MOST SUPPORTED PROJECTS OF THE WEEK-#10<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3/3/14-FEATURED ON BRICKULTRA.COM&#39;s CUUSOO OF THE WEEK!- http://brickultra.com/cuusoo-of-the-week-disney-princess-frozen-elsas-ice-palace/<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2/23/14-ACHIEVED TOP 10 MOST SUPPORTED PROJECTS OF THE WEEK- #7 OUT OF OVER 5600 IN FIRST WEEK OF BEING PUBLISHED<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother big congratulations to Frozen for passing the billion dollar box office mark !!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCongratulations to Frozen for winning the Academy Award for best animated feature film and best song!!!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": true, "tags": ["Disney", "Disney's Frozen", "Frozen", "Frozen Ice Palace", "Frozen toys", "Frozen Legos", "Disney Frozen Legos", "Frozen Lego sets", "Disney Frozen Lego sets", "Frozen Ice Castle"], "state_entered_at": "2015-10-30T14:03:25.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Fohzen", "id": 249651, "uuid": "ccbffbc0-5e88-47e4-901d-c8aac63aa42c"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "1k", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "10k", "support_ending_at": "2015-04-30T00:34:47.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Feb 19, 2014", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/0fd/3d7/393177/image", "state_id": 156, "stats_comments_count": 860, "stats_views_count_short": "360k"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:02:40.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/21b/1c9/375420/thumb", "stats_supporters_count": 10000, "published_at": "2014-02-01T19:52:49.000Z", "sold_out": false, "stats_followers_count": 1263, "stats_comments_count_short": "832", "id": 53799, "user_id": 319404, "uuid": "88bdd125-2c99-4fd7-8537-9bceccd10aef", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "X-Men: X-Mansion", "state": {"name_short": "Project Not Approved", "alias": "project_not_approved"}, "stats_views_count": 389784, "body": "Welcome to the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><a href=\"http://blog.brick-hero.com/p/x.html\">Check out our Campaign page for more project content</a><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Marvel Comics Campaign<br><br>If you are a \u201cExcelsior\u201d Level Fan of the X-Men please consider contacting the X office at Marvel: officex@marvel.com<br><br>The single greatest thing that could happen to this project would be a posting on an official Marvel page.

Our proposal includes (starting from the bottom left of the image):<br><br>\u2022 Cerebro / Danger Room Observation Deck<br>\u2022The Danger Room<br>\u2022Situation/Computer Room<br><br>\u2022First floor Staircase<br>\u2022Main Lobby<br>\u2022Laboratory/Medical Bay<br><br>\u2022Second Story Staircase<br>\u2022Classroom<br>\u2022Headmaster\u2019s Office<br><br>\u2022Top Story Staircase<br>\u2022Storm\u2019s Attic Garden<br>\u2022Dorm Room<br><br>__________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Included Figures<br><br>Ok, if you were paying attention to the picture above, there are many characters depicted, 45 to be exact.  This project will NOT include 45 X-men.  <br><br>This proposal is first and foremost to produce the X-mansion.  Of course, everyone has their favorite cadre of X-men and sadly we will not be able to include them all in a single set.  <br><br>What we propose is to include a bare handful of critical figures and leave it to Lego, Marvel, and voter feedback to figure out the rest.<br><br>Proposed Characters:<br>Xavier: He is the founder of the school of course.  We propose that he be presented in  <br>the levitating chair as depicted. <br><br>Beast: Beast is foundational character.  Very well liked and his intellect and physicality allows him to server in a variety of display and play roles.<br><br>Shadowcat: Another very well liked character that is suitable for a multitude of roles.  She is also a critical character in a variety of X-men events.  She is also GlenBricker\u2019s (one of the co-creators of this project) favorite X-man.<br><br>Gambit: Gambit is a lot of fun.  One of the contrarians of this diverse family.  He is also DarthKy\u2019s (the other co-creator) favorite X-man.   <br><br>Mystique:  This is fundamentally the home of the X-men.  The more blunt foes of the X-men would not be well suited to the concept of the set.  Mystique however is an expert of infiltration and suits very well with the premise.  <br> <br>Storm and Cyclops (Not inherently Included):  It is hard to imagine the X-mansion without at least one of these character\u2019s being included.  When we initially started this project they were both required characters.  However it has now been revealed that Lego will be producing these characters.  That of course does not mean that they cannot be included.  We just no longer feel the need to push for them as they will be in the collective of existing Lego characters, like Wolverine.<br><br>The Rest?<br>It is very hard to assess which other characters should be included or how many at that.  For that reason we are leaving the rest up to Lego, Marvel, and You.  <br>  <br>When you vote for this project make sure to tell Lego who you want included. <a href=\"http://blog.brick-hero.com/p/x.html\">Also, we have a poll on our X-Mansion Campaign Page for you to vote for your favorite X-men</a>  The highest voted character\u2019s may not get picked but its more data for Lego and Marvel to process.<br><br>As for how many will be included, well that is up to you as well.  When you support this project, you will be asked how much you would be willing to pay for a set based on this project.  Of course, your instinct will be to say $1.  Well, if everyone says that the project either won\u2019t get produced, OR we will end up with a set worth $1.  To be blunt, the more you are willing to pay for the set, the more content it will include.  <br><br>Although we are very open as to the exact characters in the final roster, it is important to us that it includes an equal (plus or minus one) number of female and male characters.  We know that this will not be difficult to accomplish as the overall roster of X-men characters.<br><br>Please note, on our journey to 10,000 supporters we may find the need to change up the proposed roster.  We give you our assurance that though we reserve the right to do so, we will only do so with great consideration.  <br><br>**********************************************************************************************************<br>Your Feedback in the Comments:  Avoiding the \u201cunexplained should.\u201d<br>**********************************************************************************************************<br>We are expecting a lot of people to comment on which characters \u201cshould\u201d be in this set.  We encourage you to give your feedback but please, elaborate!<br><br>The simple statement \u201cBeak should be in this set.\u201d is bland and lets face it, unconvincing.  There have been over 100 \u201cofficial\u201d X-men since the comic debuted in 1963, and this is ONE SET.  So, please, be creative, make a case!  <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The Danger Room</p></section><section class=\"migrated-update\"><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/d30/f25/380386/image\" data-image-id=\"380386\" data-image-path=\"migrated/d30/f25/380386/image\" data-thumbnail-path=\"migrated/d30/f25/380386/thumb\"><p>With perhaps the exception of cerebro, there is nothing more iconically associated with the residence of the X-men as the Danger Room.<br><br>That is why the Danger Room is the largest element of our design.<br><br>This is where the students come to train and hone their skills, an environment that is simultaneously safe and extremely deadly.<br><br> Now, as any real fan of the X-men knows, the Danger Room can mimic any environment required to test the mettle of the X-men.   Such a task is beyond the scope of even the most expansive Lego set.<br><br>Should this reach production we would encourage fans to use their own Lego collections in creating truly diverse environments.<br><br>We have however attempted to portray the Danger room in its default state.  Metallic walls that are ready to spring traps and obstacles that would challenge even Omega Level mutants.<br><br>We have included a variety of classic elements: a combat robot, grappling arms, rods and rings, crushing walls, and dart throwers. Not displayed are also a series of flame throwers and beam weapons. <br><br>We have designed the Danger Room to use 6 stud x 6 stud  x 6 stud architecture to allow for modular layout and easy customization.  Nearly every element can be readily reconfigured and the standard layout allows for easy customization.   <br><br>In addition to this standard \u201cobstacle footprint\u201d the other design innovation we propose is \u201cholographic villains.\u201d  We would like the set to include a series of clear 1 x 5 x 6 bricks with prints of classic X-men villains depicted on them.  This invokes the holographic nature of the Danger Room while also allowing the set to include references to all of our favorite X-foes while not ramping up the cost of the set.  The image above depicts Juggernaut  and Magneto versions of these \u201cholographic villains.\u201d<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Other Rooms<br><br>Cuusoo only allows us to show five images in a project.  For that reason we will be cycling out the following images over time to showcase various rooms and character concepts.

As we stated above, she is sporting the iconic Yellow and Black of the X-men.  Thus, such a figure could be easily modified to stand in for a multitude of other X-men characters. <br><br>_____________________________________________________________________<br><br>FAQ<br><br>*Can We get an over-sized figure Colossus or Juggernaut, like the Lego Hulk?<br><br>This type of figure is called a \"big-fig\"  In Lego circles.  Such a figure requires the creation of new Lego parts and it therefore not something we can officially request though a Cuusoo project.  <br><br>*Isn't this a bit big?<br><br>There have been been larger Lego sets to be sure but yes, it is very large.  The real question is, can the market meet the asking price?  Well, that is very hard for us to predict ahead of time.  <br><br>We are shooting for the moon and seeing what falls out.  Maybe we get the whole thing, maybe we get a smaller model, perhaps we just get the Danger Room, maybe we all just get to have fun thinking how cool it would be to have this sucker. <br><br>If nothing else, we are showcasing to Lego and Marvel just how big the demand is for these characters.  <br><br>*Why don't you split this up into a series of sets?<br><br>Cuusoo prohibits projects that directly promote a series of sets. <br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to look at (and hopefully support) our project. <br><br>Please \"Like\" the Rebrick images to help get them out to Lego fans everywhere:<br><br><a href=\"http://rebrick.lego.com/en-US/bookmark/legoreg-cuusoo---x-men--the-school-for-gifted-mutants/surebr\">*Image 1*</a> <a href=\"http://rebrick.lego.com/en-US/bookmark/legoreg-cuusoo---x-men--the-school-for-gifted-mutants/446qho\">*Image 2*</a> <a href=\"http://rebrick.lego.com/en-US/bookmark/legoreg-cuusoo---x-men--the-school-for-gifted-mutants/bj4s9x\">*Image 3*</a> <a href=\"http://rebrick.lego.com/en-US/bookmark/legoreg-cuusoo---x-men--the-school-for-gifted-mutants/bbnue8\">*Image 4*</a> <a href=\"http://rebrick.lego.com/en-US/bookmark/legoreg-cuusoo---x-men--the-school-for-gifted-mutants/q1q0hz\">*Image 5*</a><br><br>This project is brought to you by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/darthky/projects\">DarthKy</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.brick-hero.com/\">Glenbricker</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/50007\">Assault on Wayne Manor</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/56745\">Red Robin &amp; Alfred: Gates to Wayne Manor.</a><br><br>DarthKy specializes in a variety of Brick Built Figures based on popular characters.<br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/42191\">STAR WARS -Count Dooku, Ahsoka Tano, Asajj Ventress</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/41674\">STAR WARS -Yoda, Anakin, Obi-wan</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/41677\">STAR WARS -Clone Troopers</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/43097\">Batman, Catwoman, Joker</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/43115\">SUPERMAN - Bizarro, Metallo, Superman</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/44398\">SPIDERMAN - Complete character collection.</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/44624\">STAR WARS -General Grievous, Droideka (Destroyer Droid) and Battle Droid</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/44976\">STAR WARS - R2D2, C3PO and Leia with Salacious Crumb</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/45886\"> Pirates of the Caribbean- Jack Sparrow, Hector Barbossa and Davy Jones</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/46520\"> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/47771\"> Marvel - The Avengers</a><br><br>Glenbricker also has a variety of projects on Cuusoo including:<br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/29158\"> Legend of Korra: Korra &amp; Allies vs. Amon and the Mecha Tank </a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/48249\"> Magic School Bus </a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/36302\">The Discworld, Now including Rincewind!

Firefly is in fact an excellent choice.  Of all of the villains the Batman might encounter, Firefly is likely the greatest threat to Wayne Manor itself...besides, using Firefly in a set will give new purpose to all those Lego firefighters we Lego fans have.  <br><br>So, what next...well, we have the start of a story, a story about an Assault on Wayne manor.

Robin is the easy answer, but we wanted to go with something a little different.  <br><br>Part of the goal of this project is to celebrate our love of the entire continuity of Batman.  Since her introduction in the 60's, few characters of the extended Batfamily have been as consistent as Barbra Gordon / Batgirl.  Batman fans of every make and media have familiarity with her and or her uniform.  Barbra Gordon is even in the Batman Beyond animated series.      <br><br>As part of Cuusoo we also want to do our part to encourage more super heroines in official Lego products.  To date we have only received two super heroines (Wonder Woman and Black Widow) and only in two sets. <br><br>\"Lucius Fox\"<br>If we are to showcase both Bruce Wayne and Batman in a single set, the inclusion of Lucius Fox is simply put, a no brainer.  <br><br>Logistically, and in nearly every incarnation of the Batman stories, Lucius is the brains behind the continuing success of Wayne Enterprises, its business manager, freeing up Batman to pursue his ultimate goal.<br><br>Lucius is one of the extremely few, non-vigilante, characters in the DC universe who is a true friend to Bruce Wayne.<br><br>To top it off, in many of the Batman continuities, Lucius is not only a monetary mastermind but also the project manger if not actual inventor of many of Batman's gear answering the question, \"Where does he get those wonderful toys?\"</p></section><section class=\"migrated-update\"><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/bec/8bc/376409/image\" data-image-id=\"376409\" data-image-path=\"migrated/bec/8bc/376409/image\" data-thumbnail-path=\"migrated/bec/8bc/376409/thumb\"><p><a href=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2872/12105113903_271bec7945_b.jpg\"> \"Red Hood\"</a><br>Red Hood is presented as inspired by his original character design.

There is the above mentioned bookcase-batcave entrance, but there is also escape hatches under the statuary and a collapsing staircase.<br><br>More Heroes/Villains!!! (Robin, Robin 2, Robin 3+, Nightwing, Ace the Bat-Hound, Batmite, Talia, Huntress, Hush, etc..)<br><br>Any set, regardless of scale, must contain a finite number of figures.  We understand that every fan of Batman has their own preferences on who should be in set and we totally respect that. <br><br>Please also realize that we have picked the line up we have choose with the same care and respect for the franchise that we applied to every brick of the Wayne Manor. <br><br>This roster is however, just a proposal.  The core of this project is the Manor.  If Lego and Warner Brothers, in their infinite wisdom decide to go with a different allotment of characters then we gladly accept this.  <br><br>If you really don't care for our line up though, we are not the people you need to be informing, you need to tell Lego directly. <br> <br>How do you do that?  Well, first you need to write in such requests in the feedback during the \"Support\" process.  Second, and even more important, we need to get this project to 10,000 as quickly as possible.  The faster we get to 10,000 the more likely this set is to get produced, and the stronger the case will be for more figures.  So please, do your part and share this project with as many people as you can.  <br><br>This means telling your friends, telling your family, tweeting about it to followers and comic-related accounts, posting on forums, facebook, google+, pinning it to pintrest, voting for it on reddit, etc...Every vote counts. <br><br>*************************************************************************************************<br><br>Check out the References included to Batman / Bruce Wayne in the Mansion<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2F76348399%40N08%2F11188397976%2F&amp;h=wAQHO3TxA\"> here.</a><br><br>\u2022 General References<br><br>  -2 x 2 tile depicting cover to Detective Comics #27<br>  -Grandfather Clock, Often an entrance to the Batcave.

The real question is, can the market meet the asking price?  Well, that is very hard for us to predict ahead of time.  <br><br>We are shooting for the moon and seeing what falls out.  Maybe we get the whole thing, maybe we get a smaller model, maybe we all just get to have fun thinking how cool it would be to have this sucker. <br><br>*Can We get an oversized figure like the Lego Hulk?<br><br>This type of figure is called a \"big-fig\"  In Lego circles.  Such a figure requires the creation of new Lego parts and it therefore not something we can officially request though a Cuusoo project.  <br><br>*Can you add/subtract  \"this\" to the Wayne Manor?<br><br>We love the interest and feedback on what elements the project should contain.  Keep them coming!  <br><br>For the most part though, Lego is fundamentally AWESOME.  One of the ways it is awesome is in its infinite customability.   Think about this set as a template, a base structure for your ideal Wayne Manor.  Once this set is in your hands, you can reconfigure it any way you choose. <br><br>*How many Parts are In this build? <br><br>To clarify, The depicted build is simply a proposal.  Lego will produce the final model based on this proposal, therefore the exact part count of this build is not significant to the project.  However, the part count for Lego Modulars range from 2000 to 2800 pieces.<br><br>*Can I please have the instructions / LDD file?<br><br>We truly appreciate the interest in building the Wayne Manor.  It is the highest compliment a designer can receive.<br><br>At this time however, we are reserving any decisions about releasing the instructions until the review is complete.  <br><br>* Where is the Batmobile?<br><br>We wanted this Batcave to fit in the footprint of the Lego Modular and this pretty much prevented us from including a Batmobile or an awesome turntable or  break away wall for it drive through.  Additionally, Lego has many Batman vehilces already produced and we saw no reason to retread on this ground.<br><br>As you can see though, the Batcave continues...The Left and Right quarters have open passages that you can build off of.  The Batmobile could simply be in the  \"foreground\" of this build.  <br><br>Part of the awesomeness of Lego is that if you want your Wayne Manor to have the Batmobile, simply build your own (or buy one of Lego's existing sets) and build it out.  <br><br>* How did you make the Portrait of the Wayne's<br><br>There was some photoshopping involved but the source images mostly came from a app called <a href=\"http://www.sevenontwo.com\">Mini Mi</a>  I highly recommend it for quick figure design.  <br><br>*************************************************************************************************<br><br>This project is brought to you by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/darthky/projects\">DarthKy</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.brick-hero.com/\">Glenbricker</a><br><br>DarthKy specializes in a variety of Brick Built Figures based on popular characters.<br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/42191\">STAR WARS -Count Dooku, Ahsoka Tano, Asajj Ventress</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/41674\">STAR WARS -Yoda, Anakin, Obi-wan</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/41677\">STAR WARS -Clone Troopers</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/43097\">Batman, Catwoman, Joker</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/43115\">SUPERMAN - Bizarro, Metallo, Superman</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/44398\">SPIDERMAN - Complete character collection.</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/44624\">STAR WARS -General Grievous, Droideka (Destroyer Droid) and Battle Droid</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/44976\">STAR WARS - R2D2, C3PO and Leia with Salacious Crumb</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/45886\"> Pirates of the Caribbean- Jack Sparrow, Hector Barbossa and Davy Jones</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/46520\"> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/47771\"> Marvel - The Avengers</a><br><br>Glenbricker also has a variety of projects on Cuusoo including:<br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/29158\"> Legend of Korra: Korra &amp; Allies vs. Amon and the Mecha Tank </a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/48249\"> Magic School Bus </a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/36302\">The Discworld, Now including Rincewind!

The Little Prince would make a wonderful Lego set because it is a timeless classic enjoyed by children and adults all over the world.  The story was first published 70 years ago, in 1943, and there are over 2 million copies sold each year (with the total over 400 million).  It has the world record as the most translated novel in the world (over 280 translations so far - and let's translate it into LEGO together!).  This would make a great gift item for adults and children, and would be something that some of TLG's bookseller partners (for example, Barnes and Noble) could market as well in conjunction with the book.  \"All grown ups were once children... but only a few of them remember it\" wrote Saint-Exupery, but I think that AFOLs are some of the few that do.  <br><br>I have a few ideas: <br><br>THE LITTLE PRINCE: We would likely need to decide on one of two versions - 1) the iconic version used on the cover for many editions (green pants, green shirt with buttons and red bow tie, red belt) or 2) the image with the cape and sword - \"the best portrait\" - that the narrator drew of him.  Ideally the hair would be the same as the male tennis player CMF, and the sword for the second version would use the \"Three Musketeer\" CMF sword.  For the 2nd version, rather than creating a new textile robe, it would be easier to simply have him wear a blue and a red cape together.  <br><br>ASTEROID B-612: Based on the December 2013 guidance from Cuusoo, I adjusted this description.  For the asteroid, I'd either 1) use a base plate and half the asteroid coming out of it, using curved pieces that are already in the Lego supply, or 2) use pieces to make a \"ball\" out of Legos (see main image above).  This would include the rose (with glass globe), a sheep (there is now a LEGO Friends sheep), a chair, other flowers, and - of course - volcanoes to be affixed to the asteroid.  A black (or preferably dark blue) background with white or yellow \"stars\" as a base would complete this part. <br><br>AIRPLANE: Saint-Exupery crashed in the desert in real life, and that partly inspired the novel. The narrator of the story is working on his downed airplane when he first meets The Little Prince, so it makes sense to include the him (St.-Ex) and the airplane.  The airplane would include tools and food.   <br><br>There are other sections of the book that could be imagined in Lego form as well (and it would be good to have a fox - hopefully the Friends animal line will come out with one soon), but I think the two main scenes would be the asteroid and the airplane (or have one scene that combines them both - we are working on that).  <br><br>To be consistent with the new Cuusoo guidelines, my proposal is to have A) The Little Prince minifigure, B) the Asteroid B-612, and C) Antoine de Saint-Exupery with his airplane.  <br><br>I hope this proposal brings a smile to your face and that you find it to be \"unique in all the world\".</p></section><section class=\"migrated-update\"><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/8f9/ec1/390695/image\" data-image-id=\"390695\" data-image-path=\"migrated/8f9/ec1/390695/image\" data-thumbnail-path=\"migrated/8f9/ec1/390695/thumb\"><p>Here is a version of B-612 on a base plate.

Note the two Lego recreations of the narrator's \"best portrait\" of the Little Prince (from Chapter 2).  This would be paired up with the Saint-Exupery and his airplane.  I used Luke Skywalker's head and shirt, two capes, the CMF tennis player's hair, and the CMF Musketeer's sword.  Ideally he'd have the short capes like those used for Hobbit sets and of course his own Minifigure details (such as purple boots rather than completely purple legs).<br>______________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>OTHER PROJECTS: <br><br>Please also support these great projects by glenbricker (some in partnership with other great designers): <br><br>X-Men: X-Mansion: https://ideas.lego.com/projects/53799<br><br>Assault on Wayne Manor: https://ideas.lego.com/projects/50007<br><br>The Big Bang Theory: https://ideas.lego.com/projects/58456 (10K achieved!) <br><br>The Discworld: https://ideas.lego.com/projects/36302<br>______________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>THANKS to these sites for posting about the project: <br><br>http://www.thelittleprince.com/a-lego-little-prince-with-your-help-its-possible/<br>http://www.lepetitprince.com/2014/01/le-projet-lego-cuuso/<br>http://www.thelittleprince.com/the-lego-cuuso-project/<br>http://www.thelittleprince.com/a-fans-project-to-create-a-little-prince-themed-lego/<br><br>http://www.opequenoprincipe.com/blog/?p=1397<br><br>http://blogosetimoplaneta.blogspot.com.br/2013/10/lego-o-pequeno-principe.html<br><br>http://legosbrasil.blogspot.com/2014/04/lego-le-petti-prince-o-pequeno-principe.html<br><br>http://www.lepetitprince.com/2014/03/nous-avons-besoin-de-10-000-soutiens-pour-que-lego-realise-ce-projet/<br>http://www.lepetitprince.com/2014/03/un-petit-prince-en-lego-oui-mais-grace-a-vous/<br>http://www.lepetitprince.com/2014/01/le-projet-lego-cuuso/<br>http://www.lepetitprince.com/2013/10/le-projet-dun-fan-creer-un-lego-petit-prince/<br><br>http://www.toplessrobot.com/2013/11/turn_the_death_star_cute_with_little_prince_lego.php<br><br>http://www.derkleineprinz.com/2013/11/hat-jemand-von-euch-schon-einmal-eine-der-kleine-prinz-lego-figur-gesehen/</p></section>", "user_comments_locked": true, "tags": ["Little Prince", "Petit Prince", "Saint-Exupery", "asteroid", "airplane", "planet", "solar system", "Breguet", "space", "O Pequeno Principe"], "state_entered_at": "2016-03-11T15:07:41.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Colin23", "id": 444326, "uuid": "b33fa774-afe6-4f4a-a3e9-6dfe895e1130"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "1k", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "10k", "support_ending_at": "2015-09-26T18:59:27.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Sep 27, 2013", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/ed4/531/50323/1688614-o_197nfrf2r1e0t117fq0e1ue4dhl7-full.png", "state_id": 156, "stats_comments_count": 907, "stats_views_count_short": "258k"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:02:32.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/15e/127/374073/thumb", "stats_supporters_count": 10000, "published_at": "2013-08-30T20:00:14.000Z", "sold_out": false, "stats_followers_count": 1681, "stats_comments_count_short": "852", "id": 48453, "user_id": 427851, "uuid": "04deb275-9fd2-4e8a-9ca6-ebf44a6ac45d", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Bricksauria | Tyrannosaurus rex", "state": {"name_short": "Project Not Approved", "alias": "project_not_approved"}, "stats_views_count": 176059, "body": "<a href=\"http://youtu.be/c0uU6Pad8Rk\">Bricksauria on YouTube</a><br><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/115291125@N07/\">Bricksauria on Flickr</a><br><br>King of all beasts...

Your passionate display of support has, I'm sure, made an impression with LEGO. Thanks again to all who voted for this project!<br><br> This creation is based on the wonderful BBC drama \"Sherlock\", a contemporary update of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's world famous detective Sherlock Holmes. <br><br>The set recreates the consultation room from 221 B Baker St., the flat of Mr. Sherlock Holmes. As shown, the set contains 370 pieces. I think the set should come with a sticker sheet for the mirror and rug. The set was designed with the adult collector and/or fan of the show in mind and so accuracy in matching the set was a priority. There are a number of building techniques employed throughout the set and I believe it would be an enjoyable build.<br><br>This set will feature three mini figures: the brilliant Sherlock Holmes, his faithful companion John Watson and the wonderful Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock's landlady.<br><br>Please consider supporting my other project:<br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/2082/\"> The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker </a><br><br>UPDATE 9/6/13: Eye colors have been corrected and Sherlock's shirt is now purple.<br>UPDATE 9/10/13: New render of the set!

Originally this campaign was for several kits, but now I am splitting them into different projects. Because the Pirate ship was the most asked for, I am keeping this as my 'main' Goonies project. In this project there are no Lego Logos, non-Lego elements or proposed new molds. Everything in this project can be made out of exisiting LEGO, bar a few new printed decals for the minifigs. <br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Now to business. The Goonies is one of the most iconic movies of the 1980\u2019s. It gave us adventure, pirates, mobsters, the loveable Sloth and of course, the Truffle Shuffle! It was an action packed movie told through the eyes of children. <br><br>Even now, The Goonies is very much represented in modern popular culture. T-Shirts, Badges and other apparel are all available everywhere and as a franchise it is still very popular, especially to those who were young when it came out, as it is a movie very close to a lot of people's hearts.<br><br>In 2015, the Goonies will be 30 years old, so what better time than now to start a Cuusoo campaign to reignite Lego\u2019s interest in this franchise in time for the celberation? With the success of the Back to the Future set, and Ghostbusters in review with Cuusoo, there's definately enough interest in retro movies from the 80's to warrent this.<br><br>My campaign offers up all our favourite characters in Mini-Figure form, as well as concepts for several interconnecting sets, which will help kids (and adults) to re-enact the story from start to finish. The other sets will appear in different campaigns.<br><br>In regards to Lego\u2019s brand standards,The Goonies very much fits into the ethics that Lego believe in. It\u2019s fun, exciting and offers many possibilities for expansion. It is also very reminiscent of other existing Lego licensed products such as Indiana Jones and Harry Potter, and just like everyone\u2019s favourite wizard. Everything is centred on children as the main protagonists. It also has the added appeal of being a nostalgic setpiece that the older collectors of Lego will cherish.<br><section class=\"migrated-update\"><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/9ee/31c/361350/image\" data-image-id=\"361350\" data-image-path=\"migrated/9ee/31c/361350/image\" data-thumbnail-path=\"migrated/9ee/31c/361350/thumb\"><p>This set is based on the finale of the Goonies Movie, where the kids finally find the treasure.<br><br>When I created this set, I looked at some of the existing Lego Pirate sets out there. I thought the Pirates of the Carribean set 'The Black Pearl' was very similar to the Inferno so I used a lot of the design aspects from that to create this. What I didnt like about the Black Pearl set tho was that it was basically just one deck. So I have restructured the design and the Inferno is taller, and has 2 decks. You can lift part of the top deck up and there is a playset underneath, with cannons and skeletons littered about. The cabin to the rear of the ship is also bigger than the Black Pearl and opens up to reveal the dead pirate One Eyed Willy sat at his table covered in treasures. I have also added the dreaded 'plank' that the Goonies have to walk, and for fun, I added a crows nest for extra playability. Surrounding the ship are jagged rocks, and for the harcore fans, I've added the infamous 'Octopus' from one of the deleted scenes.<br><br>This is probably the 'big' set in the series, so I would have all the minifigures in this one.<br><br>* Chunk (no....Captain Chunk!!)<br>* Sloth<br>* Data<br>* Mikey<br>* Steph<br>* Brand<br>* Mouth<br>* Andy<br>* Mama Fratelli<br>* Francis Fratelli<br>* Jake Fratelli<br><br>For a larger pic go to my <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/legogoonies\">Lego Goonies Facebook Page</a><br><br>Thanks again to <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/glenbricker/projects\">Glenbricker</a> for creating a wonderful render of the model.</p></section><section class=\"migrated-update\"><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/3c0/f7b/361351/image\" data-image-id=\"361351\" data-image-path=\"migrated/3c0/f7b/361351/image\" data-thumbnail-path=\"migrated/3c0/f7b/361351/thumb\"><p>Below we have closeups of the minifigures I've designed.

They are beyond being just iconic musicians, they are content creators on another level, and their look and visual style is instantly recognizable.  Through costumes, elaborate stage lighting / structures, and even vehicles, Daft Punk have created a visual history that lends itself to Lego.  All if not most, can be recreated with preexisting Lego parts. <br><br>Examples Include :<br><br>- \"Tron\" themed creations. <br>- ALIVE 2007 stage.<br>- Classic music videos like \"Around The World\" and \"Robot Rock.\"<br>- \"Electroma\" inspired sets, like the duo's Ferrari.<br>- \"Interstella 5555.\"<br><br>Images of fan's recreations of these can be found all throughout the internet. <br><br>Daft Punk have appeared in \"Tron\" and in their own movie \"Electroma,\" their distinct visual style is clearly appealing to fans of Sci-Fi, which to me speaks to their \"playability.\"  Much of Lego's success has come from Space and other Sci-Fi/Fantasy lines.  Daft Punk should fit right in with such lines.  Space Police running security at a Daft Punk show on some alien planet?  Daft Punk rescued by the Galaxy Patrol?  Daft Punk abducted from earth during their ALIVE tour?  Endless possibilities?  The style and tone of Daft Punk aligns perfectly with Lego and would create an experience that people of all ages can enjoy.  <br><br>With this I propose a Daft Punk set, that would introduce the Robots to Lego's world as minifigures.  The set should include instruments (as pictured, maybe turntables, sequencers, mixers, controllers and a guitar for robot rocking), a simple stage with simple lighting and speakers.  Having the Robot Helmets and some new printed tiles with instruments would open the door to all the custom options.  Fan's could build their Daft Punk set into larger creations, like one's own Lego City, or some of the other things I mentioned above.  The photos I will continue to post are meant to serve as a representation of the set's playability, different minifig torsos can and should be subbed in and out to create different Daft Punk appearances, lighting and stages should be expanded, etc.  <br><br>Also important to note is that my robot minifigs are sporting helmets that are as close as what Lego makes to the real deal.  I would prefer to have custom printed visors for these guys,  Thomas's helmet should have the all black visor with printing that says something Daft Punky in LED's, and Guy's will retain the visor from my images but could maybe have some printing as well.  I will make an image soon showing what I mean.<br><br>Update:<br>May 13 - We have reached over 100 supporters in just a few days, making the #9 spot on the most supported projects.  Thank you for supporting. <br><br>May 19 - New Pic! New robot helmet!  So I have added an alternate concept for Thomas' helmet, Though I would like to express again, when this is made, it will look exactly like the real thing, as I am proposing new minifig pieces be made for this set.<br><br>May 20 - Now the #5 spot on most supported projects.  Thank you supporters. More photos coming soon.<br><br>October 24 - Finally new pics of the LED lit pyramid stage, and new outfits for the guys.  We managed to clinch the #3 spot last week on the top ten and we are now at 1500 supporters.

The minifigures are now made completely from existing Lego pieces and the full scale Tree Fort has been retired in favour of the micro-scale version. If you would like to see the full scale concept model, you can check out my Flickr set here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/65513684@N04/sets/72157634721534962/<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWho knows, maybe if this project is a success Lego will one day consider making the full scale Tree Fort, but for now the best chances of this concept becoming a reality is for it to enter review in its current form.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe micro-scale Tree Fort contains all of the details from the show. Weighing in at only 400 pieces, it would make the perfect display model and would be affordable for everybody!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/766/a90/285945/image\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The micro-scale Tree Fort also comes complete with micro versions of your favourite characters from the show: Finn, Jake, BMO, Ice King, Princess Bubblegum and Marceline. The set also features three minifigures so that you can create your own full scale creations: Finn the human, Jake the dog and of course BMO!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Tree Fort also comes with a revealable interior where you will find Finn and Jake&#39;s bedroom and the main living room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/27a/3ba/285948/image\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But why create only the Tree Fort in micro-scale Lego form? The Land of Ooo is filled with interesting locations just waiting to be given the Lego treatment.

Producing fan conceived Lego sets is the point of Cuusoo.   Projects really only have a shot at getting produced if they \"go viral\" to some extent.  So please consider tweeting the project (and tweet again a few days later to pick up stragglers!), sharing on Facebook, directly contact esteemed individuals (like Sacharissa Cripslock) an webpages that are cool enough to talk about the Discworld, and send it up every Clack tower you can find.  Even use one of Moist von Lipwig new fangled stamps....of course, a campaign to create such a Lego set would be so awesome and unpredictable that we really should avoid bringing it to the attention of the Auditors of Reality, so do your best to keep them from finding out.  <br><br>***************************************************************************************************<br><br>What is Discworld? <br><br>IF you already know and love Discworld, you can jump down to the next image...otherwise keep reading for a description of what Discworld is.... <br><br>Congratulations, you have now discovered  Discworld!  It is an ongoing series of books (and multimedia extravaganza!)  by Sir Terry Pratchett and it is quite simply one of the greatest literary continuums off all time.    <br><br>The setting of the series, (as the name implies) is disc that is balanced on four elephants which are, in turn, on the back of a giant turtle, the Great A'Tuin.<br><br>The books are inspired by our own history, literary classics of ALL breeds, mythology, and the ever confounding human condition.  The stories, while rooted in the fantastic use wry wit and cunning satire to tell very compelling narratives while also reflect real world issues, without ever getting to heavy.  <br><br>The Discworld has spawned no less than:<br><br>39+ Novels (70 million copies sold in 37 languages)<br>3 Movies<br>4 Graphic Novels<br>6 Video Games<br>2 RPG supplements<br>1 Cook Book<br><br>More detailed information about the credentials of the series can be found <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld\">here.</a>    <br><br>A lot more details about the narrative and fiction of Discworld can be found  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_%28world%29\">here.</a><br><br>Quite frankly I suggest the books to anyone who enjoys...well, anything really.

I considered attempting to build various structures described, like the Unseen University or the Treacle Mine Road Watch House, in the series but found that each one was not significant enough to embrace the scope of the series...Rincewind, The City Watch, The Witches, the Wizards, Death, Tiffany Aching, Moist von Lipwig.  <br><br>For a while I considered doing The Kite and its Crew.  In the end though, Cuusoo will only produce one set for any project submitted.  So I have decided to go with the Whole Thing.  But I have added a micro build of the The Kite (see the next last picture).    <br><br>In addition, I plan on creating a small collection of figures that, like the Discworld's elephants, form the foundation of nearly all the stories of the Disc:<br><br>Rincewind, Granny Weatherwax, Sam Vimes, and Death.   <br><br>In addition I will be including a personal favorite of mine, the Librarian.  Excluding Death, I do believe he is in the most books...except perhaps C,M.O.T.D.  <br><br>I considered adding Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler but he was charging too much for his likeness, and his sausages make me sick.   <br><br>Over the following weeks I will be adding my custom renderings of these figures to the project.  I want to take my time and do them the justice they deserve.  So check in from time to time for updates, or you can follow me on twitter, @glenbricker.<br><br>***************************************************************************************************<br>A Little More Serious<br><br>Many of you are likely aware that Terry Pratchett has early onset Alzheimer's.   As of 2010, there are an estimated 35.6 million people with Alzheimer's worldwide and the number is expected to double every 20 years.

That is not the intent though.  I will work on it a bit.  <br><br>Sam Vimes is also based on a Paul Kidby image. <a href=\"http://blog.brick-hero.com/2013/04/weekly-cuusoo.html#vimes\"> Click here to see a comparison picture</a> and the street light (shown in the top image) is based on those seen in the Discworld movie \"Going Postal.\"<br><br>My plan is to release the figures as I get them designed.  One at a time.  I would rather show you these silhouettes now and let your imagination take over than show a sub-par printing.  Regardless of the quality of my designs though, if this project reaches production, a TRUE Lego artist will design the final production figures, so you should judge the concept more on the quality you have come to expect out of Lego minifigs than anything I produce.<br><br>I have been toying with the idea of including a Terry Pratchett figure.  If I could only have one figure I would probably go with Pratchett.  I have also considered having Terry Pratchett instead of the Librarian.  <br><br>One of the big things keeping me from doing it is that a Terry Pratchett figure is pretty easy to make.  You just take <a href=\"http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Professor_Henry_Jones_Sr.\"> Sean Connery's head </a> and put it on <a href=\"http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Mutt_Williams\"> Shia LaBeouf's body </a> then add a Black fedora.  That is not something I ever imagined saying before.  You might want to swap out the pants for black ones though.  <br><br>The other reason is I am not sure he would care for it.  If he wants one though, he gets one, even if I have to make it myself.  <br><br>I would love to include EVERY character from Discworld but Cuusoo projects still have to remain with the limits of reason to get produced.  So, my selection here is based on the idea of providing a core character from every story branch of the Discworld continuum.  I mean, I love the City Watch.  If I could only have one set of characters I would go with them.  Vimes, Carrot, Angua, Nobby, Fred, and a brick built Detrius...perhaps reminiscent of the Rock species Crash and I <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/35223\"> have in this project. </a>  But that would be unfair to fans of the Witches, the Wizards, and the Death novels...so this is my compromise and I think it is a solid one.  <br><br><br>If you really really really want a sixth figure, then what we are going to have to do is get this project to 10,000 supporters as quickly as possible.  It is no guarantee but the faster a project get to 10,000, the higher the proven demand is and likely the better chances that other character could be added.</p></section><section class=\"migrated-update\"><img src=\"https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/migrated/f58/879/374379/image\" data-image-id=\"374379\" data-image-path=\"migrated/f58/879/374379/image\" data-thumbnail-path=\"migrated/f58/879/374379/thumb\"><p>Above is Rincewind and his Luggage and a Silhouette of the planned future Granny Weatherwax figure that I am currently working on.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Please consider also reviewing these other worthy projects<br>From left to right, then row by row:<br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/50323\">The Little Prince</a><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/50007\">Assault on Wayne Manor</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/16689\">Perry the In-Action Figure</a><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/11290\">Ur-Quan Masters (Star Control)</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/17123\">Majestic Airship</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/13443\">Train from Back to the Future</a><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/29158\">Legend of Korra Mecha Tank</a><br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/13696\">The Guild (Knights of Good)</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/41111\">Lady Sabre and the Ineffable Either</a><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/14460\">Hubble Space Telescope</a><br><br>And here is a list of Other great projects if you are so inclined to be curious.  <br><br>These are additional fantastic projects all with at least 200 supporters so you know they are of high quality.  <br><br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/16218\">- MegaMan Project -</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/alatariel\"> Alatariel</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/17353\">Small YELLOW</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/brickartist\"> Brickartist</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/14605\">Labyrinth Marble Maze</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/touthomme\"> Touthomme</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/22134\">Desktop Series: Sky-Fi</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/rongyiren\"> Rongyiren</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/24916\">Medusa's Temple</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/strider\"> Strider</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/17534\">Douglas DC-3</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/ssorg\"> Ssorg</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/11147\">Ultimate Collectors Series Lightsabers</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/scott34567\"> Scott34567</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/7162\">Red Squirrel</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/vuurzoon\"> Vuurzoon</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/13664\">Flying Dutchman</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/sebeus\"> Sebeus</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/11113\">Pokemon: Gyarados</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/retinence\"> Retinence</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/17123\">Majestic Airship!</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/ssorg\"> Ssorg</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/17818\">Tiny Trucks</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/robiwan\"> Robiwan</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/14089\">Transforming Retro Video Game Accessories</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/vonbrunk\"> Vonbrunk</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/1297\">Mirage (realistically speaking)</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/nannan\"> Nannan</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/13184\">Micro-build Hogwarts Castle</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/bekindrewind\"> Bekindrewind</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/18873\">Medieval Market Street</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/alexp\"> Alexp</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/17865\">WOLFPACK CASTLE</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/reekardoo\"> Reekardoo</a> <br><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/10390\">Modular Costume Store for Collectible Minifigures</a> by <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/brentwaller\"> td&gt;
