It also has weapons in the other pictures, with a machine gun and sword. It can pick up standard minifigures too. Those aliens don&#39;t stand a chance!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equipped with missiles on each shoulder, the cockpit can be opened at anytime- with an ejector seat! The mech can also be controlled by the minifigures using it&#39;s antenna and can pick up the pilot and insert it into the cockpit. So much fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s also balanced- don&#39;t expect it to fall anytime soon. Even when it has the machine gun attached to it&#39;s back- yes, it can attach a machine gun onto it&#39;s back for quicker movement- it never falls over! When holding the sword or gun it&#39;s full movement system allows it to be a great aim&nbsp;for getting rid of those aliens. By the way, being slightly bigger than your hand and a durable body makes it great for posing or showing it off to your friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s so many good things about this robot, why wouldn&#39;t you want to support it! Protect the moon base from it&#39;s certain doom with Exo- Suit 2.0!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GoldKARnage</p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.S.
