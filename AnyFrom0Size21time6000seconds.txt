This model is significantly larger than the previous versions offered in the Architecture range, but not so big that it could not be an official set. Of the 1040 pieces 464 are the small 1x2 radiator grilles which make up the vertical line features on the exterior of the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Empire State Building Fact:</strong> The Empire State Building was the tallest building in New York City for 40 consecutive years, from 1931 until 1972.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it can sometimes be difficult&nbsp;to judge the overall size of a model I have included a image of my Empire State Building next to the latest LEGO version - from the New York City set (21028) and the Eiffel Tower (21019). (King Kong minifigure&nbsp;being buzzed by biplanes is just for fun.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Empire State Building Fact:</strong> The 200 foot mast was added during the build as a mooring post to allow airships to dock in the city - although none ever did. (but this did make the building taller than the Chrysler building).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always felt that the Empire State Building deserved a larger scale model, but it was making the New York City set and seeing the strong vertical lines that the radiator grille pieces created in it that really got the project rolling. There were several challenges in making all the various rectangular exterior blocks join together seemlessly and the observation deck proved quite difficult to to create the small steps and still have studs on the sides to hold all the exterior cladding in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think this would make a great set which would appeal to fans of the Architecture range, fans of the building&nbsp;and anyone looking for a souvenir of New York City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like my design and would like to&nbsp;see it made into an offical LEGO set then please ask your friends to support it too - perhaps even ask people you don&#39;t consider to be your friends and complete strangers via social media ;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eiffleman</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["empire state building", "New York", "skyscraper", "Architecture", "USA", "NYC", "America", "empire", "souvenir", "King Kong"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-06T08:13:14.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Eiffleman", "id": 859077, "uuid": "f6cc0079-5c7d-4086-9816-09da85d0de58"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "18", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "47", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-06T08:13:14.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 06, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/003/fef/146228/2541621-o_1amrlrldj31do1p1bribsf1dg6e-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 16, "stats_views_count_short": "172"}, {"stats_days_left": 364.1401857368171, "updated_at": "2016-07-06T08:10:41.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/55e/c13/146636/2543777-o_1amvjl7201uv719mv1kstb3luoj7-thumbnail-7vUkbG_hoSEFYA.png", "stats_supporters_count": 24, "published_at": "2016-07-06T08:10:41.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 11, "stats_comments_count_short": "11", "id": 146636, "user_id": 992628, "uuid": "9990e1be-ad8b-4a18-8a5f-f6221e0e53c5", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Ferrari F40", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 105, "body": "<p>Working originally from photo&#39;s I found on the internet then changing almost everything to more closely represent one of Ferrari&#39;s most famous Super cars the Ferrari F40<br />\r\nI was successfully able to create this AWESOME little model to fit in to the &quot;Speed Champions&quot;

"<p>\u4e00\u3001</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The T-rex is the apex predator in the Cretaceous age, and the most perfect masterpiece evolution has ever managed to accomplish. Because 65 million years after its extinction, it is still the biggest and most powerful carnivore ever walked the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I first watch&nbsp;<em>Jurassic Park</em>, I was immediately captivated by the power and beauty of the T-rex, and hopelessly fell in love with her. And what beats watching a T-rex movie? Building one yourself! At 59 cm length and 930 grams weight, This model is possibly the world*&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>largest</strong>&nbsp;posable T-rex that stands on its own. * LEGO world :-)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&nbsp;like it, and want to build one yourself, pleas&nbsp;<strong>support</strong>&nbsp;me :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand&nbsp;<strong>thanks</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u4e8c\u3001Features:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. It grew bigger as the building went on, for we are all greedy in the detail department. As a result, at a certain moment, It suddenly hit me that this thing may never&nbsp;be able to stand on its own when finished, and that would be an ultimate bummer (Yes, it&rsquo;s my second MOC, I never knew LEGO was so heavy!). But due to a&nbsp;technique (mixel joints served as tendons), a lot of time and effort put into banlancing, and many compromises made to aesthetics, the completed T-rex&nbsp;<strong>stands on its own</strong>. (It may not pose a problem for digital building, but I consider this the No.1 feature of this build.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Play features: This beast is not only a display piece, It is moderately&nbsp;<strong>posable</strong>&nbsp;thanks to a lot of joints. And it has to be from the conveiving because there are so many cool postures and it would be a waste of bricks if it ends up to be just a statue. Again, aesthetics has to give way&hellip; to gaps.

I&#39;m MattTheCat12 (although if I can, I will soon be changing my username to MattTheWaffleCat (I just now found out that I can&#39;t do that, like 20 minutes later so just ignore that)) and I&#39;m back with another project that I have literally worked on almost nonstop, all day today!&nbsp;If you haven&#39;t already read the title, it&#39;s an Apple Watch!! The pictures in which there is a screen on the screen are just representations of what stickers might go well with the model based on the real thing and if you just build it without any stickers, the screen will just be blank. I did however create the screens on my own using Pages, Preview, and Powerpoint (so I guess the 3 P&#39;s that I use almost constantly) so none of the pictures are from the internet, so Lego Ideas, you can&#39;t tell me that you&#39;re not going to approve my project because I can only use my own pictures because I totally did, they&#39;re just based off of actual pictures. Anyway, the first picture uploaded is my lego recreation of the Apple Watch website (<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/watch/\">http://www.apple.com/watch/</a>). You&#39;ll see what I mean if you go to that website. Anyway, I&#39;ll continue talking about the actual project. It has a part count of 55 bricks and is pretty simple to make. I really think this project should become a real Lego Set because it&#39;s fun for kids (like me) who don&#39;t have Apple Watches. I remember when I was younger making DSs (if anyone else remembers when those were popular)&nbsp;and Laptops and whatnot and I loved it so I think this project would be great for young kids as well as adults who want an Apple Watch but don&#39;t feel like buying one!! I thouroughly enjoyed designing this project and I think that if it becomes a Lego Set, everyone who builds it will have fun as well.&nbsp;Well everybody, I guess&nbsp;that&#39;s&nbsp;all for today (and tomorrow)&nbsp;but as always, remember to click that Support button kind of in that direction--&gt; and let&#39;s go for a goal of maybe, I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s see if we can get at least 16 supporters, shall we!! If we can get to 500 (or if this project Expires) I&#39;ll put the instructions in an update!! Anyway, goodbye and remember to support!!!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["apple", "apple watch", "watch", "time", "technology", "technologic", "Apple", "\uf8ff"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-06T06:32:40.000Z", "user": {"alias": "MattTheCat12", "id": 1010810, "uuid": "c8cd3ec3-09cd-4ceb-8113-ad9863611be2"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "11", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "16", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-06T06:32:40.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 06, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/bcf/637/146517/2543274-o_1amtvgoopfkv1rkb15u01klk1f2d7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 20, "stats_views_count_short": "72"}, {"stats_days_left": 364.0716889471759, "updated_at": "2016-07-06T06:32:03.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/92f/bfc/144654/2543267-o_1amtvbn0cfq3fff1l4n1d281re57-thumbnail-fZJT0lSpZdkfaQ.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 37, "published_at": "2016-07-06T06:32:03.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 16, "stats_comments_count_short": "21", "id": 144654, "user_id": 42722, "uuid": "4cb080e8-3878-40e2-8f88-16113ebc959b", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 377, "body": "<p>In 1871, Lewis Carroll wrote his sequel to &quot;Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, in &quot;Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There&quot;, Alice crosses through the Looking Glass, and finds a book there, in which she reads the Nonsense Poem and Tale&nbsp;<strong> &quot;JABBERWOCKY&quot; &nbsp;</strong><em> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br />\r\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; And the mome raths outgrabe.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>`Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br />\r\nBeware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; The frumious Bandersnatch!&rsquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Long time the manxome foe he sought &mdash;<br />\r\nSo rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; And stood awhile in thought.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>And as in uffish thought he stood,<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br />\r\nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; And burbled as it came!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>One, two!
