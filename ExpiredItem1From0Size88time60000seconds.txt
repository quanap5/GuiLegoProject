So after thinking carefully I decided the most popular of the two must be Sherlock. Now this was before I even watched the show. I went on the internet and got a cover photo of Sherlock and Watson and made it out of legos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But after I watched the show I realized I could do better, so I popped the disc into the computer and began working. First I made the characters then I decided to go an extra step and make the flat. There was no need of the rest of the flat, only the living room and kitchen. It took me two days to build and is by far my favorite project ever:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is ten bricks tall, 32, studs wide and 42 studs long and is 1,452 bricks total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started with the living room. First I made the entrance then slowly worked my way around that. The floor is a brick tall with large grey plates on the bottom, random colorful plates on top of that and the tiles you see on the very top. I left open spaces to put regular plates and jumper plates, that way I could place the furniture. In the center you can see Sherlock&rsquo;s work table and I stacked up 2x2 jumper plates of random colors to represent stacked books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first I feared that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make the bookshelves be built into the wall but then I realized I could double the wall and have the shelves serve as part of the inner wall. Even though the fire place was never actually lit in the show I figured&nbsp;it would look livelier if I lit it. Watson&rsquo;s chair was a problem at first so I decided to stick with the simple chair look, were as Sherlock&rsquo;s chair was more complicated but it still looks comfortable looking (despite the fact that it&rsquo;s made out of legos.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sherlock&rsquo;s couch was easy, and the chess board was easier but the chair on the right hand side was a bit of a challenge and so was the bull skull. When I first made it, it was so big that it didn&rsquo;t fit. It was hard to make it small enough and still capture the look. But at last I found a solution. I don&rsquo;t know why Sherlock put his headphones on it in the first place. Anyway, the green 1x1 brick on the table is supposed to serve as a rubix cube.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kitchen was made by one screen shot and was the easiest part of the flat, with a grey banana as a sink faucet and an oil can as a welding torch. I added some beakers around the magnifying glass to make it a bit more realistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Set would include the following minifigures:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mrs. Hudson</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mary Morstan Watson</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sherlock Holmes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Hamish Watson</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Hamish Watson (Sloppy)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Hamish Watson (Mustache)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jim Moriarty</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mycroft Holmes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Molly Hooper (Lab Coat)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Molly Hooper (Wedding Dress)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Detective Inspector G.

It includes two Storm Riders and a buildable dragon with wings that flap up and down and front to back, moveable tail and neck. It also includes two Dwarven Science Guild members in their steampunk tesla tank with moveable driving crank. 360&ordm; rotating cannon tower, two spring missiles and a crystal accessible from the back to power up the engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Story</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Storm Riders once lived in one of the two moons of the Phantasy Realms world. But such a moon was consumed by a lightning storm destroying it. This is how the first drakes came to the world of Phantasy - they fled from their once peaceful home to reach to a land of turmoil and war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They first met the storm riders and shared their lightning knowledge with them and for a while they found a new home&nbsp; - a new place to live. Such knowledge gave the storm riders some leverage fighting the lava wizards whose quest for more land seemed insatiable. And peace settled in...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centuries later, some drakes decide to leave and explore the world, thus giving origin to the great Drake diaspora. In this path, drakes began breathing fire as a result of sometimes eating gold and drinking from lava pits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, many drakes remained faithful to the riders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As time went by, the Storm Riders Dwarven neighbours, tired of being the only ones in Phantasy that held no special power apart from digging deep and trading expertise, decided to invest in a University to research archane powers to increase their influence. Needess to say they found no help either from the elves nor the mystical wizards - their magical secrets were not to be shared with the Iron Dwarven. So their investigation began exploring nature and if there was power to retrieve from it... and recently, they discovered the power of the spark. This began the Dwarven Industrial era. They built many machines and contraptions to help in their daily needs. But once the Iron Dwarven began applying their newfound technology on weapons and vehicles, the Storm Riders knew war was coming and they should act fast. Only one faction should control the power of the spark. Who will it be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You choose :D</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Poll :D</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a third approach to a new original project of mine.<br />\r\nWould you mind answering a few questions concerning it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n1) Overall opinion of the set?<br />\r\n2) Is this more oriented for boys, girls or both?<br />\r\n3) Would you buy it?

Between the legs of the tower is the 5 floor visitors centre, called Foot Town. The real Foot Town includes an Aquarium, souvenir shops and resturants. The souvenir shops sell every available souvenir of Tokyo.

In his dorm, you see a bed, two weapons on display, a jar, and a meditation pool. The meditation pool was customized to Mundi&#39;s noble desires. Behind him is a little pump that drips a drop of water a minute. He does so because each drop of water reminds him of a Jedi that fell in battle, which were many in the Clone Wars (<a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ki-Adi-Mundi\">http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ki-Adi-Mundi</a> , Personality and Traits). Also, there is a place to put his lightsaber. For his lightsaber crystal, he uses a traditional Kasha crystal, a force enhanced crystal that was used as a tool for meditation by the Cerean people. He uses the crystal to help him clear his mind, both in meditation, and in battle. (Mundi would come with a blue blade to add to his hilt.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aayla Secura&#39;s dorm: In it are four pieces of furniture: two lamps, one bed, and one table. On the table is a computer and a holo-disc. She has no real bed, but instead sleeps on a cushion (green plate piece) with an extra-cushioned pillow. (Secura would come with two lightsabers, one green, and the other blue.)<br />\r\nTo produce the lighting effect, the white pieces in the lamps glow in the dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahsoka Tano&rsquo;s dorm: Although the last episode of Clone Wars, Season 5 had Ahsoka moving out, I still think that people would be interested in this dorm. She has a bed, a table, a droid repair platform, and a computer for research. Her bed has no mattress, but still has a pillow. In the top right corner, you can see that she is repairing a medical droid, trying to follow her master&#39;s footsteps.

Long have I served as the guardian spirit... I am known as the Deku Tree...&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em>, considered by many to be the greatest video-game&nbsp;of all time, was a revolutionary&nbsp;masterpiece of gaming that is&nbsp;still stunning today. Few video game characters are more iconic than Link, and the greatest game deserves to be united with the greatest toy franchise!&nbsp;This LEGO project&nbsp;depicts young&nbsp;Link and his ventures inside the <em>Great Deku Tree</em>, with opposition from Queen&nbsp;Gohma,&nbsp;her spawn&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<em>Deku Baba, Deku Scrub, </em>and<em> Skulltula&nbsp;</em>to obtain the&nbsp;<em>Kokiri&#39;s Emerald</em>: the Spiritual Stone of the forest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Concept</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing full well that this is not the first Legend of Zelda LEGO project, I sought out to create one that was as iconic&nbsp;as possible. What&nbsp;makes the Great Deku Tree so iconic is a matter of 3 things:&nbsp;First, it is early on in the game. The first lines in the game are spoken by the Deku Tree, and he is the very first dungeon in the game. Someone who only picked up <em>Ocarina of Time</em>&nbsp;for 5 minutes would have seen the Deku Tree. Second, the Great&nbsp;Deku Tree is close to home for Link. Link&#39;s home is in the Kokiri Forest, and the Great Deku Tree has been the guardian of Link and his home for all his life up to that point. The&nbsp;forest theme very much compliments Link&#39;s character and appearance. Third, the Deku Tree is influential. It is the tree that sets Link on his quest in the first place, who sets him on the path to find the Spiritual Stones and ultimately save Hyrule. Thus, the Deku Tree is a very iconic being in the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> franchise and alongside <em>Queen&nbsp;Gohma</em>, the first&nbsp;boss in the game, and several other popular enemies from the game, make a great LEGO project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Characters:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Link</li>\r\n\t<li>Queen Gohma&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Deku Scrub</li>\r\n\t<li>Deku Baba</li>\r\n\t<li>Skulltula</li>\r\n\t<li>2 Gohma Larvae</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This set features the&nbsp;Great Deku Tree with decorated exterior and interior. The inside includes torches, a&nbsp;spider&nbsp;web on floor (as seen in the game), several ladders and plants,&nbsp;2 pots: one with a health-replenishing heart and one with a&nbsp;green rupee, and a treasure chest containing the Kokiri&#39;s Emerald. Link is armed with his&nbsp;Kokiri Sword and Deku Shield, and his hat has hair printing on the front, to match his appearance in the Legend of&nbsp;Zelda franchise. Queen Gohma has articulation in her legs, claws and tail, and her eye can rotate in all directions. The Deku Baba&#39;s mouth uses a&nbsp;clam piece (30218), and can open and close. The Deku Scrub figure depicts the creature hiding in the bushes, launching Deku nuts from its mouth (as in the game).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;Support!&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re a Legend of Zelda fan or just a fan of a good LEGO set, click that support button!

the good raw materials are sent to the processing unit where they are converted into parts and then loaded into to bins.&nbsp; (The parts are actually on the ground behind the building and must be loaded into the bins by hand).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bins with blue markings contain all parts needed to build a small hot rod car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bins with red markings contain all parts needed to build a small pickup truck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the bins are loaded they are then lifted by a hoist on tracks and moved over and lowered onto a flat bed transport.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flat bed transport then takes the bins to the Assembly Plant (red building with blue roof).&nbsp; The flat bed transport pulls in under a hoist on tracks.&nbsp; This hoist then lifts the bins off the flat transport and takes the bins inside the assembly plant.&nbsp; Once inside the bottom of the bins open and dump the parts onto another conveyer.&nbsp; This conveyer then carries the parts to the assembly line workers (this conveyer is operated via a human&#39;s hand).&nbsp; The assembly line workers then assemble and test the small hot rod cars and small pickup trucks.&nbsp; Once passed the vehicles are parked outside and await for delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notes:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-There are two parts missing, grab buckets part number 4614755 (not in LDD 4.3)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-The conveyer on the Crushing Complex requires four V-Belts to operate.&nbsp; I left four possible V-Belts that may work on the ground behind the pits</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-I spent 7 hours trying to line up the conveyer in the Crushing Complex.&nbsp; I am 99% positive it will fit into place.&nbsp; I left the requires axles and parts to do the final assembly in the red wheel barrel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most challenging part of my project was the &quot;float\\&quot; to move the excavator.&nbsp; I had to completely redesign it three times.&nbsp; I was almost ready to give up on it after 20 hours.&nbsp; I spent a total of 25 hours designing and building that float (using the LDD 4.3).&nbsp; It actually turned out exactly how I wanted it to.&nbsp; Most of the time was spent on the detachable tongue section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The small working fork lifts were a little bit of a challenge also (approximate time 5 hours).&nbsp; I had made several designs for the lifting system but they were too tall to fit into the buildings and they had no height adjustment.&nbsp; The forklifts I designed (final design) have three height adjustment, ground position, carry position and lift position.&nbsp; This final design also fits into all of the buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Parts Manufacturing Complex I believe is over 5000 pieces on its own.&nbsp; This one took some time, around 100+ hours.&nbsp; I started with the lunch room, went up, then over, then up.&nbsp; After three levels high I then went back and finished the right ground level.&nbsp; This building ended up twice as tall as per my original plan/idea.&nbsp; It took a lot of time to put stairs and ladders to gain access everywhere, the gears also took some time to line up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am extremely happy with this project.&nbsp; I think the whole thing is &quot;AWESOME!&quot;.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t change anything about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing I&#39;m not happy with is the two missing parts in the LDD 4.3 (part # 4614755).&nbsp; This grab bucket has been around for 40-50 years and it is not in the LDD 4.3...</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Awesoem Lego Car Factory"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-07T17:50:01.000Z", "user": {"alias": "454SuperDuty454", "id": 887100, "uuid": "7a999bf6-4ac7-4c20-b403-54584cb1084c"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "7", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "20", "support_ending_at": "2016-07-07T17:41:55.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 08, 2015", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/8fc/bbf/108295/1983684-o_19pj0tq7p1t3c73j7vm18pe1p77c-full.png", "state_id": 154, "stats_comments_count": 12, "stats_views_count_short": "1k"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-09T06:03:13.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/78c/7c4/108270/1982944-o_19pin2qb0rpf69tul1hqi1hqt7-thumbnail-RlZuLGqDozUsJg.png", "stats_supporters_count": 60, "published_at": "2015-07-08T17:00:42.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 10, "stats_comments_count_short": "13", "id": 108270, "user_id": 872320, "uuid": "406789e6-a9d2-4de1-b9f9-07e13d358c92", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Off-Grid Homestead", "state": {"name_short": "Expired", "alias": "expired"}, "stats_views_count": 1208, "body": "<p>This &quot;green&quot;, environmentally-friendly homestead has everything you need to be off-the-grid and lower your carbon footprint.

I was then inspired by an online friend or to be more precise the particular food she enjoys - Poptarts, so i went with the crazy idea of a poptart cyber cafe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Characters - Currently i have five: On the left are the three workers, The Happy counter girl and her two assistants, one who remains on the upper floor to keep an eye on things and help with technical issues, provide food and drink, coordinating through headsets with the one downstairs who performs the same tasks but also manages stock should the other assistant run low and need something from the stock room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the right are the two basic customers. (Concerning all clothing - This was the best clothing i could throw together so it can be altered if necessary)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ground floor - A walled front with a little greenery leading in to the ground floor. Both floors have 2 person table/desk, each with a computer/games console (My own preference was to put down black boxes with a colored light to represent game consoles or Black Personal Computer cases in order to make them stand out a little), space for whatever juice drink or coffee is purchased and beside each computer is space for a box of poptarts to sit, all bought at the front of the store which has its own small store room and delivery entrance, two convenient free use microwave ovens, one located under the stairs and one by the counter for cooking said poptarts either on request or when the need arises. Lastly the ground floor has a two stall bathroom and sinks i included to break things up a little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upper Floor - Similar setup to the ground floor minus the counter and instead a coffee dispenser and a single microwave oven which the upper floor assistant monitors and operates. The balcony area is mainly for those seeking a little quiet time or maybe they also brought a laptop which they intend to use while enjoying the scenery. Also shown is the roof of the store room, this roof however is completely separate from the upper floor and is included in the image to show its general overall location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Main Roof -&nbsp; Up here are two power generators/hubs/servers and one very large satellite dish for wireless access and streaming TV/news on the monitors. Lastly is of course what every such place needs, a nice giant poptart themed sign big enough to fit the SPC and it even has a small bite taken out of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMinor Issue - Some may notice tiles missing under tables such as the coffee dispenser/microwave table on the upper floor, tiles were placed but each time i loaded the file&nbsp; to make alterations it would warn me of tiles improperly placed and remove them.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Poptarts", "Cyber", "Cafe"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-07T16:50:01.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Wraith4K1", "id": 644539, "uuid": "2b939b28-a1ae-4389-99e0-66826b78446e"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "8", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "47", "support_ending_at": "2016-07-07T16:49:29.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 08, 2015", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/bd9/3cc/108017/1982986-o_19pio8lpsg7d1n8f654ol7ds4c-full.png", "state_id": 154, "stats_comments_count": 13, "stats_views_count_short": "1k"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-09T06:03:13.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/75e/ec3/108199/1982461-o_19pi2ou7jb041rl07i698ff101k-thumbnail-Lrzc4UWjYqPPgg.png", "stats_supporters_count": 50, "published_at": "2015-07-08T16:44:14.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 13, "stats_comments_count_short": "11", "id": 108199, "user_id": 888366, "uuid": "6b285e2f-739f-4fe1-87e8-5793b24aea74", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "The Royal Chess", "state": {"name_short": "Expired", "alias": "expired"}, "stats_views_count": 1450, "body": "<p>We will start the project description by some figures:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>2103 bricks</li>\r\n\t<li>1209 bricks for chessboard</li>\r\n\t<li>894 bricks for game piece</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The chessboard and its pieces are perfectly playable and well recognizable, the tower, the rider, the fool, the queen, the king and the pawn, one immediately recognizes which is which.

1999</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Eagle One</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 13th, 1999, the Earth&rsquo;s Moon was blasted out of orbit due to the massive explosion of Waste Disposal Area Number 2 on the Moon&rsquo;s &ldquo;dark side&rdquo;.&nbsp; The 311 crew members (inhabitants) of Moonbase Alpha were left to survive on their own as the Moon rocketed into the unknown.&nbsp; As part of the many support vehicles on Alpha was a fleet of Eagle Transporter interplanetary spacecraft that were utilized for transport, reconnaissance, rescue, defense and a plethora of other duties in deep space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Eagle Transporter was of a modular design, consisting of a two-person command module in the nose, two modules with manoeuvring thrusters and landing pads and an interchangeable pod in-between.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nose and aft sections were held together by a strong, overhead latticework structure under which the various pods were &ldquo;hung&rdquo; from.&nbsp; A number of pods were developed, consisting of a passenger pod, reconnaissance pod, rescue, freighter, laboratory and others, plus interchangeable cranes, winches and other equipment.&nbsp; The Eagle was powered by four fusion rockets in the aft module and some were armed with a powerful laser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Space: 1999&rdquo; was Gerry Anderson&rsquo;s third live-action TV Series and one of his most successful, produced between 1974 and 1976, with a total of 48 episodes over two seasons.&nbsp; It was originally developed as a second season of &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; as &ldquo;UFO: 1999&rdquo; that took place on a Moonbase some twenty years after the original series, but morphed into its own show.&nbsp; &ldquo;Space: 1999&rdquo; starred then husband-and-wife Martin Landau and Barbara Bain, and was noted for its detailed sets and spectacular special effects.&nbsp; One of the highlights of the show was the Eagle Transporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About The Design</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been enamoured with the Eagle ever since I first saw the spacecraft in &ldquo;Space: 1999&rdquo; in 1975 as an 11-yr-old.&nbsp; I loved the functionality and the modular design that made it seem real.&nbsp; The Eagle was designed by Special Effects Supervisor Brian Johnson, and in the back-story was a Bird-of-Prey series craft, like the Hawk and Swift vessels seen in later episodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like my other designs, I used Lego Digital Designer to fabricate this model of Eagle One, and I am indebted to Craig Norris for his hard work on the renderings.&nbsp; My intent was to make the model Minifig scale for play value, and not just make a display model that would be built and left on the shelf.&nbsp; Thus, this potential LEGO Ideas model has many play features that make it a play-able LEGO set as well.&nbsp; Obviously, this meant having interiors for the Minifigs to be in and, of course, Minifigs themselves, of which five are included.&nbsp; When designing the model I imagined what I, as an 11-yr-old, would have wanted to have included.&nbsp; The result is what you see here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, and foremost, I wanted Eagle One to be fully modular, and thus the Pod is removable from the main Eagle structure.&nbsp; Rather than attach it to the overhead spine, four latches made from Technic parts are fitted to the Pod &ndash; two in the front and two in the rear.&nbsp; These slide into Technic bricks in the front and rear modules, and are attached to the vertical thrusters on the underside of the Pod so as to camouflage them (see illustration).&nbsp; Thus, pushing the vertical thrusters moves the latches into position.&nbsp; This allows for play to be accomplished with the Eagle craft &ldquo;and&rdquo; the Pod separately.&nbsp; I also made the command module nose section detachable.&nbsp; This design element was showcased in the episode &ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Domain&rdquo;, and, again, Technic bricks are used as attachments.&nbsp; The nose itself has a removable roof to access the interior for two Eagle pilots, and includes controls and forward windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This removable roof feature was also incorporated into the Pod as well, and, this also features a full interior.&nbsp; For the best play value, I chose the Reconnaissance Pod as this features both seating in the rear for four Minifigs and a computer in front, where the Alpha Minifigs can investigate new planets and other phenomena.&nbsp; Both side doors can open.&nbsp; Obviously, this allows all five Moonbase Alpha Minfigs to be placed in Eagle One.&nbsp; To simplify the design, the sliding door has been omitted in place of a clamshell system of upper and lower doors.&nbsp; A series of steps on the lower section replaces the stairway that would &ldquo;magically&rdquo; appear on the Eagle in the TV Show once landed.&nbsp; As the dark sections on the top of the Pod are actually windows, I elected to put real windows there rather than just black bricks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the Minifigs, I have included five.&nbsp; These consist of Commander John Koenig, Doctor Helena Russell, Professor Victor Bergman, Chief Eagle Pilot Alan Carter and Main Mission Controller Paul Morrow.&nbsp; I felt these were the most important characters in &ldquo;Space: 1999&rdquo;.&nbsp; In creating the look of the Minifigs, I chose to use the First Season uniforms and characters, emulating the Moonbase Alpha uniforms designed by Rudi Gernreich.&nbsp; The exception is Alan Carter, whom I have put into the Eagle astronaut suit, with helmet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final result is a large model, with an overall length of 61.5 cm (24 in) and a brick count of 1100 &ndash; including the five Minifigs.&nbsp; This is the result of it being of &ldquo;Minifig-Scale&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, despite this, Eagle One is still much smaller than actual scale, and would be much larger if properly scaled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One final note.&nbsp; My intention when developing Eagle One was not to fabricate a 100% authentic reproduction of the Eagle Transporter from &ldquo;Space: 1999&rdquo;.&nbsp; Rather, Eagle One is designed as a play set to capture both the spirit and essence of this wonderful craft.&nbsp; This allows the LEGO model to be played with, and yet also to be displayed as an homage to this British Gerry Anderson-developed Sci-Fi TV Show and the fantastic designs therein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Details</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Length overall:&nbsp;

Little features include and turning ticket barrier, a smooth arena floor which the carts can move around easily and also the addition of a removable roof which makes playing with the set much easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think this would make a great playset for those that collect these sorts of models and younger children as they are most likely to love going to theme parks and going on rides like this and the abilities to play against family and friends with this set makes it a great set for families to enjoy together.

The model itself is built from less than&nbsp;300 pieces and, with the exception of a few Technic parts to attach the legs, it is all bricks, plates, slopes and tiles.&nbsp; It has movable legs, arms, hands and head. &nbsp;Its body can also easily disconnect from the legs,&nbsp;just like a regular minifigure. &nbsp;The legs can move from upright to seated (90 degrees movement forwards and 33 degrees movement backwards).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Concept</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To have a creative set, bucket or box that contains the pieces that would enable you to create a Jumbo minifigure&#39;s legs, body, arms and head with extra pieces to be able to create different shirt fronts and hats. &nbsp;For example LEGO set 10696 - Medium Creative Brick Box contains 484 pieces and I would expect that it would be possible to create a set of similar size and cost that would allow for my Jumbo minifigure model&nbsp;with left over pieces to create different shirt fronts, hats and possibly&nbsp;even tools or furniture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I originally made a Smurf (shown in other images) and my kids immediately fell in love with it. &nbsp;They would carry it around and pose it, but I had a problem with the leg attachment because it wasn&#39;t strong and the legs would detach or the body would&nbsp;fall because of its weight. &nbsp;So I spent a lot of time working on that, trying to&nbsp;<span>get them&nbsp;just right, with the right amount of clearance to move the legs and the right amount of friction to enable the model to stand up and support the weight of the body&nbsp;and hea</span><span>d.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that it is sturdy enough the kids&nbsp;want&nbsp;to build their own but while we have a lot of LEGO, finding the right quantities in the right colours can be difficult and I thought that it would be great to be able to simply buy the model. &nbsp;We recently purchase a large brick box which has tons of bricks in it, just not quite the right ones. &nbsp;So I thought that maybe it would be a good idea to submit this project to LEGO ideas.&nbsp;This&nbsp;got me thinking about coming a with a more refined design that would make it good for kids with the ability to get creative and use their imaginations a little&nbsp;and&nbsp;I came up with the idea of a model that makes it fairly easy to change the shirt front design and potentially the face&nbsp;also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from my other images I have come up with a few simple designs in LEGO Digital Designer which&nbsp;makes it really easy to try different things out and create nice images. &nbsp;It shows how easily you can redesign the model. &nbsp;It could be a lot of fun trying to recreate a scale model of your favourite minifigures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another&nbsp;cool thing about the size and scale of this model is that it makes it really easy to use 2x2 bricks to build things to scale with. &nbsp;So if you have boxes of regular bricks it is easy to make tables, chairs and other furniture and utensils that scale well to suit this model, without being so large that you need too many bricks to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not really sure which specific shirt style and hat is the best, but I am also not certain that this is an important part of the concept, at least at this point. &nbsp;LEGO will know which themes are the most popular and if my idea manages to make it that far it would be easy for them to work out what they think would work well, but feedback from the LEGO community would also help. &nbsp;The Fireman/Police man pair has the least differences between the two models. But I feel like having a bunch of 1x1 and 2x1 plates of varying colours to enable you to design your own shirt fronts would be the best way to go. &nbsp;The whole idea here is to have the right pieces to get the base model correctly, then you can integrate with other LEGO&nbsp;that you already have to come up with new designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make your own</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you like my design and are inspired to&nbsp;make one for yourself. &nbsp;If you have kids then make one with them, I am sure they will love it as much as my kids do. &nbsp;My daughter has tea parties with the Smurf! &nbsp;I would love to see what designs you can come up with. &nbsp;I would especially love to see how you would model characters from all of the LEGO minifigure series so far. &nbsp;For me hair is the challenge, I just can&#39;t work it out, but I am sure there are plenty out there that could. &nbsp;For kids it doesn&#39;t have to be complicated though which is why I feel my design would work well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if my model doesn&#39;t make it all the way to the top, it would be great to start a Jumbo minifigure trend! &nbsp;Thanks for reading.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["jumbo", "minifigure", "minifigure scale", "creator", "creative", "model"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-06T14:20:01.000Z", "user": {"alias": "jenakai", "id": 885699, "uuid": "9a81839a-5a1b-4767-a70f-8f991beb3ba9"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "9", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "61", "support_ending_at": "2016-07-06T14:17:50.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 07, 2015", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/1f1/a34/107905/1979400-o_19pbefiru8c7ln712jqem2sbkc-full.png", "state_id": 154, "stats_comments_count": 21, "stats_views_count_short": "1k"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-09T06:03:12.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/19f/079/107865/1978670-o_19pag7aa0a1o1k44hm1s4hiqn7-thumbnail-6FXy-0EwfST3ew.png", "stats_supporters_count": 11, "published_at": "2015-07-07T14:12:17.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 4, "stats_comments_count_short": "4", "id": 107865, "user_id": 640195, "uuid": "b927c91f-e5b1-41cd-ac97-9a0a2260b9a3", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Camp Wanoxett", "state": {"name_short": "Expired", "alias": "expired"}, "stats_views_count": 626, "body": "<p>Camp Wanoxett sure to shine on!

He rolls without problem, and the head can rotate 360 degrees. The Imperial pit droid is an updated version of the pit droid from Episode I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the pod racer and speeder are solid and are <strong>made to be handled and played with</strong>. Each can be simply set on top of their respective train cars, and <strong><em>racing </em></strong>is the name of the game!!

The rest of the British fleet quickly surrendered to the Americans, securing Lake Erie and helping turn the tide of the war on the Great Lakes in favor of the United States.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Niagara </em>served on the Great Lakes for the remainder of the war before being sunk for preservation in 1820.&nbsp; Remarkably, the ship was raised in 1913 for the centennial of the Battle of Lake Erie and, after decades of restoration setbacks, was finally presented as a working ship in 1990.&nbsp; Today, the <em>Niagara</em>, with a host of modern upgrades, serves as a sail training vessel for the United States Coast Guard.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was my first attempt at building a Lego ship.&nbsp; I was drawn to the <em>Niagara </em>for several reasons.&nbsp; I wanted to build a model of a historic vessel with an interesting story. The <em>Niagara</em>&#39;s story was certainly fascinating, especially because the ship is still afloat today.&nbsp; Also, I wanted to build the project to minifigure scale, and the <em>Niagara </em>was large enough to make an impressive model but not so large as to be unfeasible for production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A brick-built model would have several notable differences to the LDD project.&nbsp; The sails would preferably be cloth instead of bricks and cables could be provided for rigging, holding the boats and anchors, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The model is around 4500 pieces as presented, which could be substantially reduced with cloth sails and some refining of the hull construction (I believe a price point of $200-250 could be realistic).&nbsp; It is built primarily for display but with a few minor adjustments could be made very playable.&nbsp; I would like for the ship to include at least one minifigure: her commander Oliver Hazard Perry.&nbsp; It could also come with an expanded crew for increased playability.&nbsp; Three detachable boats are included, as well as 18 carronades and 2 long guns. The ship could be presented either complete or only above the waterline, depending on whether an &quot;out of water&quot; or &quot;afloat&quot; presentation is desired.&nbsp; It includes a movable tiller and rudder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Though this is a warship, it should meet Lego&#39;s standards as a historical vessel (after all, Lego has produced its own USS <em>Constellation</em>).&nbsp; If it would be preferable, the <em>Niagara </em>could be presented in her current form with all but her ceremonial armament removed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpecial thanks to my fellow Lego Ideas user LuisPG and his outstanding HMS Beagle project for inspiring some of the techniques used in this build.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Ship", "Navy", "War", "Sail", "Sailing", "Niagara", "History", "Vehicle", "Display", "Boat"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-01T20:50:01.000Z", "user": {"alias": "skypilot22", "id": 181454, "uuid": "a34cb7da-cfd0-41a1-8e52-15419a155fe8"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "57", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "279", "support_ending_at": "2016-07-01T20:42:48.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 02, 2015", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/137/246/107122/1969350-o_19osm3qu71ve599s12n96sd8ei7-full.png", "state_id": 154, "stats_comments_count": 61, "stats_views_count_short": "2k"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-09T06:03:10.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/eb9/242/107044/1968538-o_19or07vifa741nro1cu1juppo28-thumbnail-kpgEWwSjfvxyyg.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 150, "published_at": "2015-07-02T20:41:22.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 22, "stats_comments_count_short": "20", "id": 107044, "user_id": 859204, "uuid": "786e417d-baf9-441c-90fe-2d6e528f47c4", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Voltron: Defender of the Universe", "state": {"name_short": "Expired", "alias": "expired"}, "stats_views_count": 3899, "body": "<p><strong>Voltron: Defender of the Universe</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Lion Force Voltron (Voltron of the Far Universe)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more than 30 years <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron\" target=\"_blank\">Voltron </a>has been defending the Universe in various forms.

The Incredibles, a family of superheroes, alongside their longtime friend and partner <em>Frozone</em>, face the ultimate threat of <em>Syndrome</em> and his mighty Omnidroid. Will the super-strong <em>Mr. Incredible</em>, the mega-flexible <em>Elastigirl</em>, the ultra-speedy&nbsp;<em>Dash</em>, and the force-field creating&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>&nbsp;be able to stand against&nbsp;Syndrome?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minifigures included in this set:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mr. Incredible</li>\r\n\t<li>Elastigirl</li>\r\n\t<li>Violet</li>\r\n\t<li>Dash</li>\r\n\t<li>Frozone</li>\r\n\t<li>Syndrome</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This set includes syndrome&#39;s Omnidroid with highly articulate legs and flick-fire missiles, a lamp post, and Violet&#39;s force field bubble. Elastigirl could come with two torsos, one with a long arm that could be bent to a desired shape, or could be pulled back and released to launch the manhole cover.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This set appeals to fans of Disney and Pixar animation, boys and girls alike, as well as teen and adults. Since LEGO&#39;s Disney franchises are mainly marketed towards little kids (in Duplo) and only girls (with the Disney Princess theme), this set would be a great addition that would be accessible to everyone. I hope you enjoyed looking at this set based on one of my favorite Pixar movies.
