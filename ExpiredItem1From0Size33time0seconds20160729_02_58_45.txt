This is not the case this is not just a simple copy paste example of a pyramid structure. This precise build is based on 64x64 area, this being 4 bases of the 32 x32 boards giving huge scale and stunning effect to this Build set. The main&nbsp;exterior&nbsp;bricks are made up from 1x1 and 2x2 bricks place purposely for&nbsp;stunning effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internals of the build reveal an accent to the Queens chamber suspended within the walls of the pyramid this then leads to another accent up&nbsp;to the king&#39;s chamber following the same precise angle from the queens chamber&nbsp;of&nbsp;-42.73 degrees (the main reason the angle of the raise&nbsp;is so precise is that the upper floor will not match the pyramid side to hold the suspended&nbsp;brace&nbsp;if the angle is too steep or not steep enough this did take some calculating and some deleting). This then giving similar effect internally to the actual structure made thousands of years ago in Egypt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would estimate this took 200hrs+ to create that been a guess, although taking this into consideration the time spent on this model I would say anything from the hard-core enthusiast 4hrs to the expected 8hrs build time these obviously are only my guesses however any LEGO fan would have great fun doing this model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main picture shows a duplicate of the top section showing that this can be removed to&nbsp;access&nbsp;a viewing panel within the pyramid,&nbsp;The set&nbsp;would also be accompanied with a&nbsp;LEGO pharaoh figure and a detail plaque with the relevant information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This set would be a fantastic addition to anyone&#39;s collection&nbsp;sitting perfectly alongside the likes of the Taj Mahal and Sydney Opera House.

Deep into the heart of the woods lies a patch of mushrooms, big and small, with the land&#39;s biggest mushroom known so far. This is&nbsp;where the rumor is true, for this mushroom, and all the others which bask in its shadow, are full of magic. An elderly couple of Gnomes, Andrake and his wife, Midela, are the only ones who know how to turn the mushroom&#39;s solid magic into great potions that can heal the sick and give strength to those who have&nbsp;none. However, Evil also wants the magic for its&nbsp;own selfish gain.&nbsp;Can YOU, young adventurer, help defeat Evil&#39;s Orc minion and protect the mushroom and its magic secrets from Evil&#39;s clutches? YOU decide!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Set: </strong>This set includes the landscape (which is made up of individual bricks), the Gnome&#39;s cottage (with a fully functional opening and closing door), the magical mushroom, decorations (such as fences with chains, flowers, grass, smaller mushrooms, an owl, snowflakes (the solid magic from the mushroom), a bed, desk, torch, barrel, etc.), and three minifigures with accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>The minifigues in the LEGO Digital Designer pictures are different than what I wanted the actual minifigures to look like. Therefore, I have included hand drawn pictures of the character in real life and what I would like to be their Lego version. First, Andrake the Gnome would have short green legs, a red body with printing of his green suspenders (on the front and back), and a red bandana. His head would have printing on both sides: FRONT: a happy expression and BACK: an angry expression or&nbsp;the back of his head. His beard and eyebrows would both&nbsp;be gray, or white, or gray and white. Andrake&#39;s accessories&nbsp; would include a black blacksmith hammer (pictured in the set), a pearl gray colored sword (pictured in the set), a blue potion (not pictured), a green potion (not pictured), and a bottle (pictured in the set). Next, his wife, Midela. She would have a light blue&nbsp;2 by 2 slope&nbsp;brick (with printing on the front) as a dress. Her body would be the same light blue as the dress with printing on the front and back. Her head would have a calm, happy expression on the FRONT, and a scarred expression on the BACK. I think some wrinkles under her eyes would make her look older, as Midela and her husband are about the same age with Andrake being 107 years old and Midela being 104 years old. Midela&#39;s hair and eyebrows would also be gray, or white, or gray and white. On her dress would be strips of gold (on the pictures I drew it metallic gold which looks a lot like brown, but it is supposed to be gold). Midela&#39;s accessories would include a bucket with a stud (which is the same color as the mushroom&#39;s snowflakes (solid magic)). Last, but certainly not least, the Orc. The Orc&#39;s main color is a green that is different from the grass of the set and from Andrake&quot;s green potion accessory.&nbsp;His armor pads are supposed to be a gunmetal gray color (the same color LEGO did for the Uruk - Kai armor for the Lord of the Ring sets). He would have a brown hip piece with the same brown as his straps for his chest armor. A lighter brown (light brown) color would be used for the other armor straps and cloth in front of his legs. He would have leg printing, FRONT and BACK printing, and printing on only one side of his head with a fierce, angry expression. His hair would be black. Also, his face would have a printed nose!&nbsp;The Orc&#39;s&nbsp;main accessories would be a gunmetal gray colored sword and a red shield with a skull, slash marks, and (possibly) bolts printed on it. Some other accessories to include instead of the sword would be a spear, spear with axe, different sword, or mace (I have not figured out a color scheme for these, possible, accessories yet). All three minifigures would have their color of flesh, colored ears printed on their head or hair. Andrake: head, Midela and Orc: hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other:</strong> The set has a total of 754 bricks. The chains in the LEGO Digital Designer picture are supposed to connect with their corresponding posts (they are floating because I gave up trying to put them on correctly). The biggest chain is supposed to fall on a middle post (but again I could not accomplish the task on LEGO Digital Designer). This set would be part&nbsp;of a series called &quot;Once Upon&nbsp;A Time&quot;. Midelda&#39;s name is pronounced as &quot;Medella&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Problems:</strong>The only problem with the set that I can see it that the terrain does not all connect.

Ergo, I have decided to create the first. The Temeraire series is of a fantasy / alternate history genre and is set during the Napoleonic Wars, but with a catch: there are dragons, manned by crews of aviators, who form the airforces of that time. The series follows Captain Will Laurence and his dragon, Temeraire as they fight for Britain as part of the Aerial Corps. I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys reading fantasy or alternate history novels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Temeraire - Mountain Hut</em>&nbsp;is set during the the first book,&nbsp;<em>His Majesty&#39;s Dragon</em>&nbsp;(<em>HMD</em>), towards the start of the book when Laurence and Temeraire have to leave their friends to train as part of the Aerial Corps. It may not appear as an actual scene in&nbsp;<em>HMD</em>, but LEGO sets are rarely exactly the same as the scene that they were based on. The project includes 3 characters:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Captain Will Laurence</li>\r\n\t<li>Captain Tom Riley</li>\r\n\t<li>Temeraire</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\u200b<strong>Temeraire - Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Temeraire has been designed so that he is flexible, yet sturdy. The joints used in his construction include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Ball Joint - used to connect wings and front legs to body, and used to connect feet to legs.</li>\r\n\t<li>Mini Ball Joint - used in tail.</li>\r\n\t<li>Rotation Joint - used to connect neck and back legs to body.</li>\r\n\t<li>Ratchet Joint - used in neck.</li>\r\n\t<li>Clip Joint - used to connect jaw to skull.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the joints, there are lots of other features that add to the detail. These include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Wings - the wings are designed so that they can swivel to almost any direction, and also fold back and out of the way when he lands.</li>\r\n\t<li>Body - the body has a few features to make it more realistic, including sloping and being bulkier at the front.</li>\r\n\t<li>Tail - The tail, like the wings, is designed to swivel in almost any direction.</li>\r\n\t<li>Neck - The can turn almost any direction thanks to the rotation joint at its base. The rest of the neck is connected using ratchet joints so that it can shift around depending on Temeraire&#39;s position. The centre part of his neck also features a large medallion, a present that Laurence gave to Temeraire.</li>\r\n\t<li>Head - The head has a moveable jaw so that Temeraire can grab hold of things with his mouth. He also has blue translucent patches on his ruff.\u200b</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mountain Hut - Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mountain hut is a log cabin covered in snow. The top level is detachable so that you can access the bottom level beneath. Inside, it contains a few gadgets. These include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Fireplace</li>\r\n\t<li>Worktop w/ cauldron</li>\r\n\t<li>Water barrel</li>\r\n\t<li>Chest of books</li>\r\n\t<li>Desk w/ map, compass, lamp, and book\u200b</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More to Come &hellip;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the first Temeraire project that I&#39;ve made, and I&#39;m planning on at least two more to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for checking this project out and please support!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Temeraire", "Black", "Dragon", "Novik", "Mountain", "Hut", "Log", "Cabin", "cottage", "snow", "Fly", "Captain"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-27T19:20:01.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Bj\u00f8rn!", "id": 429993, "uuid": "f9d50691-2c28-4810-97c9-67da9f532ca1"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "8", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "24", "support_ending_at": "2016-07-27T19:10:10.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 28, 2015", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/343/abf/110540/2014797-o_19r1vrvfuf6jeiuh8m162lmh8e-full.jpg", "state_id": 154, "stats_comments_count": 7, "stats_views_count_short": "755"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:04:10.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/799/74d/109847/2011642-o_19qt0oeaa18sp4i947rnts154iu-thumbnail-y-YV4Js9y4zasg.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 41, "published_at": "2015-07-28T19:09:23.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 15, "stats_comments_count_short": "12", "id": 109847, "user_id": 693297, "uuid": "cc666e54-219d-4441-af6b-febc9a60fd05", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Haunted Mountain", "state": {"name_short": "Expired", "alias": "expired"}, "stats_views_count": 1169, "body": "<p>A brave adventurer is looking for the legendary lost golden sword, believed to be hidden within a mountain cave.

The portal, also encased in Microbot structures, has a center piece that can be knocked over (perhaps by super-jumper Fredzilla or Honey Lemon&#39;s chem-balls), and entered by a minifigure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A family-friendly movie like this would make a great LEGO set that would appeal to all ages, boys and girls alike, as well as teen and adult fans. With colorful characters, a sinister villain, and a playable set, this project would create a fun and affordable addition to anyone&#39;s LEGO collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Support now! </strong>Don&#39;t forget to comment and share this project!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out my other projects:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Incredibles vs. Symdrome&#39;s Omnidroid: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/107717\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/107717</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Captain America: Birth of&nbsp;a Super-Soldier: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/99897\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/99897</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legend of Zelda: Great Deku Tree: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/108310\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/108310</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cat in the Hat: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/87086\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/87086</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And more: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/profile/ToaRickBrick/projects\">https://ideas.lego.com/profile/ToaRickBrick/projects</a></p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["big hero 6", "disney", "hiro hamada", "baymax", "fredzilla", "gogo tomago", "honey lemon", "wasabi", "yokai", "marvel", "superheroes"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-27T19:10:01.000Z", "user": {"alias": "ToaRickBrick", "id": 654294, "uuid": "f78b0684-db10-44eb-a531-26a6f11e94de"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "92", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "558", "support_ending_at": "2016-07-27T19:08:49.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 28, 2015", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/952/35b/110529/2014633-o_19r1i9e63hgi1nn8vtu47ij6e8-full.png", "state_id": 154, "stats_comments_count": 75, "stats_views_count_short": "6k"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:04:12.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/3cf/6b9/110536/2014776-o_19r1o9f7omopabg1jct16a9kis7-thumbnail-D4igc_OPae3txA.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 314, "published_at": "2015-07-28T19:08:16.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 80, "stats_comments_count_short": "296", "id": 110536, "user_id": 8618, "uuid": "d0aaa05c-b4c8-467e-a435-932344f8eaef", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "City Bank ATM", "state": {"name_short": "Expired", "alias": "expired"}, "stats_views_count": 1930, "body": "<p>All the latest city sets have missed this one thing which fills every modern town and city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An automatic teller machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add a humble old lamp post and a mail box for the passer by to mail their letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is built on an 8x8 plate, pavement, wall with ATM, red post box, white lamp post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Optional can be&nbsp;a minifig, the character is street sweeper with equipment (see second image)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cost of this set would be under 20 dollars US, only a postal service sticker and card slot/keypad sticker are required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like this please support and follow it, thanks for reading and Brick On everyone !&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["City", "ATM", "Post", "Mail Box", "Street Lamp"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-27T19:10:02.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Lightningtiger", "id": 8618, "uuid": "66644c4b-c613-478c-97d2-909c19c73377"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "80", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "314", "support_ending_at": "2016-07-27T19:08:16.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 28, 2015", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/3cf/6b9/110536/2014776-o_19r1o9f7omopabg1jct16a9kis7-full.jpg", "state_id": 154, "stats_comments_count": 296, "stats_views_count_short": "1k"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:04:12.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/07e/87d/110514/2014550-o_19r1b5v7p1l6516arviq14hprv4h-thumbnail-GGt2X699mTDpXQ.png", "stats_supporters_count": 51, "published_at": "2015-07-28T19:07:44.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 12, "stats_comments_count_short": "22", "id": 110514, "user_id": 803445, "uuid": "521fcb6d-0cda-4902-877e-ad4d03b95c80", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "The Brady Bunch Staircase", "state": {"name_short": "Expired", "alias": "expired"}, "stats_views_count": 2108, "body": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s the story...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brady Bunch home&nbsp;is one of the most recognizable television homes of all&nbsp;time. In the center of that home is the iconic staircase where the family has stood many times, arranged in order from the youngest at the top, to the oldest down below. The staircase wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without that iconic horse statue located below the banister. It has been seen standing in the same position throughout all of the Brady years. The build-able staircase becomes the perfect place to display the entire LEGO Brady Bunch!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Brady is dressed in their grooviest outfit and posses an item or article of clothing that represents some of the best known episodes from the series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg carries a guitar and is dressed as his chart topping, alter ego, Johnny Bravo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marsha, Marsha, Marsha can&rsquo;t stop brushing her hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter sports a Hawaiian shirt that he brought back with him from their unlucky vacation in Hawaii. (Do I see a tiki doll LEGO&nbsp;piece in the future? Or will the cursed prop still bring bad luck?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jan tries to be different and more popular in her interchangeable, curly, dark brown wig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Bobby looks more like Sherlock Holmes than a Brady, that&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s been hired by &ldquo;the youngest one in curls&rdquo; to help her solve the case of the missing Kitty Karry-all doll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, there&rsquo;s Alice. The Brady&rsquo;s just aren&rsquo;t complete without their butcher-loving housekeeper (with frying pan)!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, this episode of the Brady Bunch includes a&nbsp;&quot;twist&quot; in the plot!&nbsp;In truly&nbsp;TV studio set fashion, spin the staircase around and you won&#39;t find any bedrooms or Mike&#39;s work den -&nbsp;instead, blue boxes (as seen in the show&#39;s opening credits) house each one of the figures! Now you have two ways of displaying the entire build-able Brady Bunch!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brady&#39;s have become an ever-growing, <em>far out</em> franchise - including 5 seasons of the original television series, an&nbsp;animated series, a spin-off series, a variety show, multiple reunion specials, music albums, a stage play, and two top-grossing theatrical movies. It&rsquo;s time to take another step up that unmistakable, iconic staircase and turn the entire Brady Bunch, into the next most sought after LEGO set!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cue opening sequence - LEGO-style!

When Savage finds Darth Maul, he brings him home to Dathomir, where Mother Talzin gives new legs to Darth Maul. Maul then goes out, with his brother by his side, to find Kenobi, and get his revenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They fly the Turtle Tanker that Savage had stolen to a nearby planet. In order to get Obi-Wan to come to them, they terrorized the people, and threatened through a holo-message to the Jedi Council that if Obi-Wan did not come to the planet, Darth Maul would kill all the people. Unaware of Savage&#39;s presence on the planet, he goes to confront Darth Maul. However, when he gets there, Savage and Darth Maul are quick to bring him down. They then take him aboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As they lift off, they are unaware that Ventress is watching. She sneaks onto the ship as it takes off, and hides in the ship. As Maul was about to skin Kenobi alive, Ventress knew she needed to get their attention onto her. Using her &quot;witchcraft,&quot; she draws the brothers into the control room. Once the door shut behind them, she goes down to help Kenobi up. Unfortunately, the brothers hadn&#39;t really left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now surrounded, Ventress hands one of her lightsabers to an unarmed Kenobi. They then work together in an attempt to defeat the brothers. During the battle, Ventress loses her lightsaber. Kenobi takes his lightsaber back from Darth Maul&#39;s belt, and tosses Ventress&#39; second lightsaber to her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a while, Kenobi realizes that they would not win this fight. He and Ventress then fight past their opponents into the cockpit. Initiating the escape pod, the cockpit closes the glass door right after Ventress enters. The cockpit then detaches itself from the ship, and shoots off into space, leaving Maul and Savage staring after them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Turtle Tanker is an unusual star ship. It is generally used for cargo, has four legs, each foot containing an impulse engine, and two large doors on each side of the ship. As you may notice, Savage is taller than in the Sith Nightspeeder set. He&#39;s supposed to have black Woody legs, a black version of Woody&#39;s legs from Woody and Buzz to the Rescue. This would make him about the same height as Darth Maul, as in the show.<br />\r\nVentress would also come in a new print, wearing her Bounty Hunter outfit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you like this set. I have to say, I had a great time building it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May the Force be with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.S. &ndash; Here is the fight scene<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlJiphrbLyg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlJiphrbLyg</a></p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Star Wars", "Clone Wars", "Sith", "Jedi", "Bounty Hunter", "Cargo", "Star Ship"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-26T17:50:01.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Xendor", "id": 247959, "uuid": "4b3bc6ac-ceb6-4dab-bd55-2f1737a46452"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "9", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "30", "support_ending_at": "2016-07-26T17:44:44.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 27, 2015", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/896/8c8/110508/2014423-o_19r14cif71a9g12v019ket8i125oe-full.png", "state_id": 154, "stats_comments_count": 6, "stats_views_count_short": "2k"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:04:10.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/b5e/57c/109438/1998662-o_19q9nka4sp37scqjhpkdvrsmc-thumbnail-qgPmlrpMkXzG2A.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 15, "published_at": "2015-07-27T17:39:21.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 2, "stats_comments_count_short": "5", "id": 109438, "user_id": 892929, "uuid": "e996b19c-86a7-4188-a7a6-c8e6d8460859", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "The Starfighter", "state": {"name_short": "Expired", "alias": "expired"}, "stats_views_count": 684, "body": "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the The Star Fighter.
