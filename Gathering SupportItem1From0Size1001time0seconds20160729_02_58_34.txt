The single-engine fighter was the fastest and most versatile fighter in the fleet, but was lightly armed and armored. It does have a large fuel tank and powerful engine, plus twin blasters tipping the wings. The wing ends are also reinforced, so that only one extending landing gear leg (located under the main power converter) is necessary to land the craft and balance it perfectly on flat surfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The construction of the ship itself is quite unique, employing multiple advanced building techniques.

This theme is going to be extended into say one big set, one medium set and one small set (like how Lego do it now) which can give it a bit of a footprint on toy shelves (also there are some custom chest prints for the minifigures when they haven&#39;t got their chest armour on, this&#39;ll be posted later).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason why I think this would make a good Lego set would be because you don&#39;t see a lot of sets out there that are based upon mechs that have good articulation; this set does go back to having the &#39;clicky&#39; joints which were used in the old exo force sets (that was the main inspiration for this set).

The Luggage is a&nbsp;magical, bottomless travel accessory&nbsp;on hundreds of tiny pink legs given to Rincewind by a tourist named Twoflower. It is intensely protective and will protect its owner from anything, which has included sharks, demon kings, tribal sacrifice, and strange creatures from other dimensions with far to many limbs and tentacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some liberties have been taken with the building of the cart itself as it is never properly described in the books. Because of this, the general feel of Dibbler is what the cart was based off of when it was designed. Complete with roasting&nbsp;rat, moldy sausage, flavour disguising condiments,&nbsp;and decaying canopy, the cart would be a fantastic play piece. Also, Dibbler comes with the ingredients that he uses to make his sausages.

I have for a few years wanted to build a Lego megazord, It took me a few months to complete my design, and i feel happy with how it turned out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Features:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>5 zords (Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Mastodon, Saber tooth tiger, and Pterodactyl)</li>\r\n\t<li>Increased poseability, ratcheted knees, feet, and hips, ball joint shoulders, head swivel</li>\r\n\t<li>All zords have separate modes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be quite a few stickers on this design, in order to get an accurate appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The images of the separate zords are not rendered yet, It takes me a very long time to complete full sticker designs, they will look just like the toy stickers,&nbsp;i will work on those and add them later</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used BlueRender and Paint to create the main image</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope everyone likes my idea, please support, share, and always keep building</p>\r\n\r\n<p>thanks, TheHAWK1209</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["lego", "power rangers", "megazord", "vehicle", "mecha"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-27T07:30:25.000Z", "user": {"alias": "TheHAWK1209", "id": 941031, "uuid": "4ba1dc95-f3de-4bab-9edf-5b0d3a372326"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "10", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "26", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-27T07:30:25.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 27, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/2fb/89a/148902/2577589-o_1aol078o4aah1heueqp1sditnp7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 8, "stats_views_count_short": "180"}, {"stats_days_left": 363.56354913591434, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:14.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/631/f6a/148882/2577520-o_1aoklleocnmeu43p5i7puvfs7-thumbnail-BFqytGQAuZmyJQ.png", "stats_supporters_count": 10, "published_at": "2016-07-27T07:29:26.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 6, "stats_comments_count_short": "25", "id": 148882, "user_id": 593307, "uuid": "e614dee7-45cb-4cb7-b515-81c8ccaf39c9", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Girl Meets World: Apartment", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 100, "body": "<p>Riley is the daughter of Cory and Topanga and she goes to school with her friends Maya and Farkle and new person Lucas who Riley likes.

I not English native, so please bare with me, ok?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While working on my <strong>Microfighter - Series X1</strong> project, I had this idea of making a microfighter out of the <strong>Sandcrawler</strong> with 100 pieces or less and now I present to you my project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although at a microfighter scale, my project had to have loading/opening ramps and should be completely hollow, but I couldn&#39;t do it and stay below the 100 pieces mark. So there&#39;s &quot;only&quot; 2 side loading ramps and a rear ramp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1x2 clamps on top of the side ramps are there because when I made the prototype (I&#39;ll upload some photos later of it) it was very difficult to open them, so I had to find something to help the process. With that in mind, I went for the clamps because in that position, they look like little cranes to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also added some pieces that should go <span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\"><span>disassemble in side the <strong>Sandcrawler</strong> to look like random stuff the Jawas found/stole/bought everywhere, but when put together, they would make up </span></span>a Medical Droid (or better yet) a very colorful Medial Droid as you can see in the last picture (the 4 1x1 bricks are there just for scale). I thought this do be a great original idea but... WRONG!!! After watching a review about the Sandcrawler, <span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\"><span>I found out that t</span></span>he Lego designer of the <strong>Sandcrawler</strong> had this idea first so... <span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\"><span>originality</span> <span>becomes</span> <span>a tribute</span></span> to that Lego designer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prototype also showed me that the side ramps don&#39;t need a 2x2 slide shoe to open and close without any problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As some of you know, most of the Lego&nbsp;microfighters series has some kind of flick missiles (ok, some have small shooters), but the <strong>Sandcrawler</strong> is a civilian <span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\"><span>vehicle, so missiles was a no go. Instead</span></span> I used a mini shooter to look like the thing the Jawas used in the movie to capture droids like R2-D2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All said and done, in the end and with the Medical Droid, the piece counter stopped at 100. Yes!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments, <span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\"><span>suggestions</span></span> and ideas are welcome and I also hope you like it and support it. If you do...

I think it would be a great conversation piece and if you think so too, click that support button and spread the word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for your time and support!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["boat", "vehicle", "functions"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-26T06:41:27.000Z", "user": {"alias": "ktwatt", "id": 647979, "uuid": "a1185b58-c449-49b2-ac12-be839490cb23"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "10", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "13", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-26T06:41:27.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 26, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/edd/cf5/148786/2575777-o_1aoi7b5cj13f81mmc1c3ap8shq67-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 14, "stats_views_count_short": "61"}, {"stats_days_left": 362.5290999205787, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:14.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/461/396/148743/2575130-o_1aohjod1u1vl31ice1v9h1vkdrh8e-thumbnail-rfeENE0fWKSm_Q.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 23, "published_at": "2016-07-26T06:39:50.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 12, "stats_comments_count_short": "9", "id": 148743, "user_id": 990935, "uuid": "9abc3381-f3af-402f-8ed6-d4d0f961717e", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Accident", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 170, "body": "<p>This is an accident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This interesting little set includes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>2 minifigures (2 young men/painters).</li>\r\n\t<li>3 animals (a brown cat, hen and a rat).</li>\r\n\t<li>3 teddy bears.</li>\r\n\t<li>a motorbike.</li>\r\n\t<li>a lunch box, toolbox and 2 painter brushes (on the shelf).</li>\r\n\t<li>a painting (on the inner wall).</li>\r\n\t<li>2 food advertisements and a warrant (on the outer wall).</li>\r\n\t<li>a&nbsp;hand&nbsp;truck, 2 breakfast cereals, 2 pet foods, milk, cup drink, newspaper and a hotdog (inside the house).</li>\r\n\t<li>a garbage bin, bottle, canned soup, meat, donut and a sushi (outside the house).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I built this little set because I think that is an interesting good idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe this little set would be a great set because it is really original, unique and creative.

To access the Batcycle you simply fold out the hood into a ramp, the Batcycle can then roll out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Features:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Batcycle Cockpit integration</li>\r\n\t<li>Hood folds out to become ramp</li>\r\n\t<li>Mini-figure scaled, can hold one Batman figure</li>\r\n\t<li>520 piece count</li>\r\n\t<li>Opening cockpit screen</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope everyone likes my idea, please support, share, and always have fun building</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t forget to check out my other ideas</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>1969 Camaro</li>\r\n\t<li>1967 Camaro</li>\r\n\t<li>Animated Series Batmobile</li>\r\n\t<li>Batwing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheHAWK1209</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["lego", "batman", "batmobile", "vehicle", "car"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-25T06:36:50.000Z", "user": {"alias": "TheHAWK1209", "id": 941031, "uuid": "4ba1dc95-f3de-4bab-9edf-5b0d3a372326"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "11", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "35", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-25T06:36:50.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 25, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/186/35d/148624/2573216-o_1aoep39klje61uelken15b24tic-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 8, "stats_views_count_short": "189"}, {"stats_days_left": 361.52601860489585, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:14.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/e03/b79/148540/2572325-o_1aoceca5a16vlm57c3tdirckqe-thumbnail-_GHd3KKEW63a5w.jpeg", "stats_supporters_count": 12, "published_at": "2016-07-25T06:35:24.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 8, "stats_comments_count_short": "7", "id": 148540, "user_id": 1093717, "uuid": "be9d762a-8352-44a4-b8ca-77c17f1d9415", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "The Lego Giant", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 104, "body": "<p>This massive Lego figure towers above all Hero Factory and Bionicle sets made,&nbsp;its no surprise really&nbsp;after all it is 66 cm ( 26 inches) tall.

This time&nbsp;with higher quality images so you can see the project like never before! Unfortunately this project didn&#39;t reach the 10,000 mark on its first try, so I have improved the image quality and have many updates planned to see if we can make it this time!&nbsp;Without any hesitation, lets move on to the original description from the first <span>iteration of this project, as always, happy building!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Original description</strong> &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is my Portal 2 damaged test chamber model. This is my own design test chamber featuring some of the most important details of the Portal 2 testing chambers! This project is&nbsp;also my first project built in LDD (Lego digital designer)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The set</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This set contains many details from Portal 2 test chambers, one of the harder things to replicate was the damaged, but still operational look that many of the chambers had. This project features: a simplified exit door, an aperture science&nbsp;500 megawatt super button for the cube, a blank cube, a thermal discouragement beam (a&nbsp;laser), a removable glass panel, a turret, a&nbsp;discouragement redirection cube and of&nbsp;course&nbsp;Chell with her portal gun. There are other parts as well that you can use to customize the chamber, these are pictured at the front project and are: 2 configurable panels, an extra cube and button, a hand operated button&nbsp;and&nbsp;a discouragement beam&nbsp;receiver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of the chamber is to have a set that is full of accurate detail, but easily changed to a different look by adding the extra components and removing others. The chamber is raised off the floor so a pit containing the cube can exist in the floor above, and maybe to replicate the escape scenes in the game. This test&nbsp;as it is without the extra pieces, can be solved!&nbsp;Move the redirection cube so the beam is re-directed on to the turret, destroying it, then&nbsp;portal down into the pit behind the turret to obtain the cube. (shown in the third picture) Then place the cube onto the large button to open the door and escape!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Details</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am unsure of how many pieces the set contains, but I assume it is in the 100-250 range, maybe more. The doors don&#39;t actually open, and the laser can&#39;t easily be extended any further, and the set doesn&#39;t have any portals, but that may come later in an update. The large button, turret, glass panel and all plants can be removed for construction of your own tests using the extra pieces, however the damaged wall, door, laser&nbsp;and pit are all permanent and cannot be easily removed. If this becomes a official LEGO set, then&nbsp;printing or a decal would be needed on the blank cubes to give them the in game textures, also Chell and maybe her portal gun would need printing to add further detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like this project and want to see it as a set, then please support!

There should also be the beige colour on the snot bricks on the main tower but unfortunately I did not have many in that colour.

The surf is up and so is the new Surf Shop! This set is for anyone who loves surfing, for boys&nbsp;</span><em>and&nbsp;</em><span>girls. You don&#39;t even have to be a surfer to like this set! &nbsp;Pictures above can display items that come along with the set. Obviously, there is the surf shop. A fake giant octopus hangs on the wall in&nbsp;the front. A dolphin statue is placed to where it seems like it is jumping over the roof. The surf shop can also open up.&nbsp;Inside the surf shop are two surf boards displayed for window watchers. More surf boards in various colors are lined up against the wall, along with two skate boards. On the other wall, various shirts and pants are hung&nbsp;up.&nbsp;In the middle of the surf shop, is a front desk&nbsp;with a man sitting behind the counter, a&nbsp;tip jar and a cash register in front of him. Outside of the surf shop, a young man is waxing his board, his trusty dog besides him. Also sitting outside is a bike rack with bikes in various colors. One girl&nbsp;is filming her brother jumping over a rock while on a&nbsp;skate board. Behind them, a telephone booth is being occupied by a very frustrated woman. There is a smaller&nbsp;building and on&nbsp;it&#39;s roof, sit giant letters spelling the word &quot;BATH&quot;, particularly meant to mean &quot;bathroom&quot;. The bathroom can also open up. Inside there is one sink. Next to the sink, stands another door leading to the toilet. As I said before, all of these features can be found in the pictures above.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>I think this would make an&nbsp;awesome LEGO set. Never before have I seen anything like this in LEGO stores. I think this set would be a great&nbsp;</span>opportunity for LEGO to expand in the &quot;beach lifestyle&quot; type of business. The only set I have seen that had something to do with a beach scene was the Beach Hut LEGO set. It&#39;s actually a pretty nice set, and without a doubt, this set is just as nice, and has a great chance of selling in stores. However, I can&#39;t get to stores&nbsp;without your help. I need your support. You&#39;ll have to create an account but don&#39;t worry it&#39;s free! Hit the support button, even if you can&#39;t really see yourself having this set, or maybe you don&#39;t really like it. Why? Think of all the other people who like this set! Help them out by helping me out. &nbsp;I&#39;d be beyond appreciative and couldn&#39;t say thank you enough. I need 10,000 supporters, so tell all your friends and family, then get them to tell all their friends and family. Spread the word! If you can spend 4 hours playing video games, then you can take 10 minutes to create a LEGO ID account and support my project. Another thing, don&#39;t forget to support my other project: The Old Quarter Inn. Just do it!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["surf", "shop"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-22T06:36:13.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Phantom3019", "id": 1110724, "uuid": "12390c41-d937-4c10-8416-0850414b9edd"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "4", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "8", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-22T06:36:13.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 22, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/026/646/148301/2568990-o_1ao595t421a5q1eecvnbg6l1ethe-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 4, "stats_views_count_short": "68"}, {"stats_days_left": 358.5234775690162, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:12.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/d76/df4/147512/2569712-o_1ao6q14pi1ltiu801ceb13oc6nh31-thumbnail-xq343yZM2J2rsw.JPG", "stats_supporters_count": 74, "published_at": "2016-07-22T06:31:45.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 23, "stats_comments_count_short": "20", "id": 147512, "user_id": 756298, "uuid": "5d388160-898f-4d79-a4e8-35db29eb090f", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Medieval House - Knights house", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 255, "body": "<p>Medieval House - Knights House</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the sets story:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This set is about a medieval knight who have been on job the whole day.

If you go back in the house, then you can push a button that will make it get light in the fire. This set contains two minifigures, one dog, one horse, some knights stuff, dinning table, kitchen table, one chair, one bed and one bookshelf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&acute;t know that this sets will go through.

I had lots of space on the roof of the office building, so I built a &nbsp;helicopter with <strong>three seats</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>a table</strong>, and a&nbsp;<strong>pilot&#39;s seat&nbsp;</strong>complete with&nbsp;<strong>realistic controls</strong>. I hope to have this become a set because I had to build this myself. I have always wanted a good&nbsp;looking, passenger helicopter for my mini-figs, but I have been too lazy to make one. This set will allow kids to get a cheap set with only one thing in it: a simple helicopter, which is all they wanted and&nbsp;needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, there already IS a LEGO VIP helicopter. You may be familiar with it, LEGO set 3222 &quot;Helicopter Limousine&quot;. But personally, I think it is not only a little, but VERY expensive. $200 dollars! That is what makes this set so great. I can&#39;t be overpriced since it is only a helicopter and nothing else.<strong> If you like it, please support this project.

In children the potential benefits are staggering. A project like this would&nbsp;foster a love of Lego, a love of engineering, and a love of music. It would be a perfect gift for parents to give their children to introduce them both to music and design. Tired of fighting your kids to practice an instrument? Get them emotionally invested in an instrument by having them build it first!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, consider that many elementary schools in the U.S. introduce the ukulele as one of the first instruments for kids to start learning.&nbsp;This project provides a practical application of Lego that&nbsp;serves as&nbsp;a natural bridge between an elementary school kid&#39;s love of Lego&nbsp;sets and the middle school/junior high elective tech classes (like robotics and engineering) that are based on using Lego Education sets like Lego Mindstorms.

There is also fog lights built into the front bumper. Big thanks to LegoBricker for helping with the grey line on the front grille.&nbsp;Under the hood is a small but powerful 4 cylinder&nbsp;engine. The interior is rather simple. It contains three black seats, a steering column, a set of speedometers, and a completed dash. The exterior of the cabin has black mirrors and door handles. The rear door handles are the black pieces behind the right side rear window. &nbsp;The rear of the cab stays really close to the original SUV. it has the taillights that rap around and go down into the reverse lights. It also has red deflectors&nbsp;in the bottom of the bumper. It also has a rear hatch door handle in between the taillights. The SUV is in Lego&#39;s olive green color.&nbsp;This set contains 113 bricks and could easily sell in the $10 to $15 US currency range.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you all for supporting!

Have tea and crumpets with the&nbsp;hilarious Mad Hatter. Endure insanity as you (try) to play hide-and-seek with the sneaky Cheshire Cat. Look! The March Hare is here as well! (Although I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s just a man in a bunny suit.) Wait, stop. Is that the villainous&nbsp;Queen of Hearts&nbsp;and some of her evil henchmen? (Is it her unbirthday?) Holy fat cats, Wonderland just got a little more mad than it already was! (No offense to you, Cheshire.)&nbsp;Become a part of the color and fun at this (apparently more than) Mad Tea Party, or it&#39;s off with your heads!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ever&nbsp;since I watched the old (and new) movie/s, I have been&nbsp;crazy about&nbsp;Wonderland!&nbsp;No pun&nbsp;intended. Well, it was sort of intended. The new remakes 2015-2016 were amazing, and they have become extremely popular!&nbsp;Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t seen one LEGO Set out there that seems even&nbsp;remotely related to Alice in Wonderland. Maybe they&#39;re out there,&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure. But&nbsp;they&#39;re not in&nbsp;any&nbsp;stores near me. This is why I strongly believe this LEGO Set is a perfect idea, and it sorely needs to be in LEGO stores. Although this set may not be this&nbsp;awesome building or some gigantic set that everybody wants, I can see a little girl or boy playing with their friends making up some ridiculous story line about this (more than) mad Tea Party. This set is not straight out of the movie, and that&#39;s what makes it (somewhat) unique, but of course it&#39;s just a generic idea. I have enormous&nbsp;flowers:&nbsp;a rose, a&nbsp;sunflower, and a lotus flower. I also have giant mushrooms, and each one has it&#39;s own color. The Cheshire Cat has his own, special tree, and there is also a doorway where Alice arrives from. I have the Queen of Hearts&nbsp;riding high on her horse, with red carpet under her. The poor soul behind her is rolling up the red carpet as the Queen&nbsp;goes along. Of course we have the actual table and&nbsp;chairs where the Mad Hatter and the March Hare (99% sure he&#39;s just a man in a bunny suit) sit. All these items can be found in the pictures above. There are 587 bricks. Even if you may not see yourself getting this set, or&nbsp;you&nbsp;simply just don&#39;t like it, support it anyway. Why? Think not of only yourself, but others.&nbsp;Maybe you have a younger sibling who likes Wonderland as much as I do. This set can be a nice present, whether it&#39;s for a birthday or Christmas. Think of even&nbsp;strangers! You may not like this set, but others who support me do! This LEGO Set can&#39;t&nbsp;get to stores if I don&#39;t get the !0,000 votes, so I need your help! Support it!

Headquarters), including characters such as Jimmy Olsen, Red Tornado, Indigo/Brainiac 8, Non and Maxwell Lord, however assumed many fans would like to receive &lsquo;classic&rsquo; variations of such figures before these CW &lsquo;variants&rsquo;.&nbsp; I also heavily considered including the show&rsquo;s unique incarnation of Martian Manhunter (/Hank Henshaw), however thought my set may then appear too similar to LEGO&rsquo;s 76040 Brainiac Attack, and given the choice of my inspiration of the S01E18 <em>&lsquo;Worlds Finest&rsquo; </em>scene, would not be show-accurate (though I&rsquo;d still love to see him produced in an accompanying polybag set, such as the official LEGO 30603 Batman Classic TV Series &ndash; Mr. Freeze).&nbsp; Original characters such as Winn Schott Jr, Astra In-Ze and Alex Danvers were omitted due assumed preference of original comic characters and likely a general lack of interest from potential consumers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Originally, I planned for the set to also include a NCFD Fire Engine, however quickly abandoned that idea, to reduce the set&rsquo;s piece count and keep the set at a largely affordable price, instead including a newly designed fire hydrant as a placeholder.</li>\r\n\t<li>The set is specifically designed so that it can easily be integrated into other LEGO sets and themes for maximum creativity and playability, especially LEGO City and other Super Heroes sets.</li>\r\n\t<li>Please note I have not included the necessary minifigure prints and piece decals on builds, especially the helicopter, in order for viewers to use their imagination and so as not to detract from my build.</li>\r\n\t<li>Note that due to LDD&rsquo;s issue with colouring the recently added dual-molded leg piece, both Supergirl and Silver Banshee&rsquo;s legs in the final images have rendered incorrectly, and are unable to be fixed.&nbsp; Supergirl is intended to have Dark Stone Grey upper legs and hips (representing her tights) and New Dark Red lower legs for her boots.&nbsp; Silver Banshee has Black upper legs and hips, and White boots.</li>\r\n\t<li>Regardless of the eventual result and eligibility of my project, I hope that this design inspires others to create their own models and designs, be it for&nbsp;<em>Supergirl </em>or any other project they wish to design and hope to come to fruition.&nbsp; If there is sufficient demand, I will upload the .lxf file online and link in the description for those who wish to make their own modifications or physically build the model.</li>\r\n\t<li>I&rsquo;m still only fairly new to the program LDD to POV-Ray Converter in order to render the final images, so any suggestions to improve quality (especially lighting) are definitely appreciated.</li>\r\n\t<li>Comments, suggestions and questions are welcome!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Coming Soon...&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The Flash</em>: <em>S.T.A.R.

Due to a grand supply of milk,&nbsp;and&nbsp;apparently a great demand, it was decided that milk would be the only beverage&nbsp;provided for the good people of Lego Town. (And of course water for the lactose&nbsp;intolerant).&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love old things, and I also love food,&nbsp;so I decided to combine the two into my very own LEGO Set! Without a doubt, this would make a great LEGO Set! I haven&#39;t seen many LEGO restaurants in stores. They&#39;re out there, but they&#39;re certainly not common. I&#39;ve decided to give LEGO another restaurant to place in their stores. The Old Quarter Inn has it&#39;s own unique style. It is my own unique design.&nbsp;It appears old and looks somewhat like an old European building, and yet it is a modern restaurant. The set comes with various LEGO figures. A cook, waiter, checkout guy, The Milker (she serves only milk and makes an exception for&nbsp;water for the lactose intolerant), and of course, the lovely customers. The staff are dressed in costumes to make the restaurant come to life. The customers also vary. There is the cute, young couple sitting outside under a parasol. Inside is the CowBar where a business woman sits with a computer, working, along with a man and a brief case. Upstairs is a few dining tables. An older couple are having a romantic dinner, and they are being asked by the waiter if they want milk or water (for the lactose intolerant). &nbsp;Also upstairs in the next room are a fun-filled family laughing it off waiting for their dinner. Now talking about physical features. There are 964 bricks.&nbsp;The roof is&nbsp;dark red with lights sitting on the side of the roof. There is a balcony&nbsp;for a couple who wants to be alone. Upstairs there are two joining rooms with an open archway. Inside one room is a booth and two small tables. Inside the other is two dining tables and little candles in the middle of each. Downstairs there is the kitchen with a little gate. Inside the kitchen is an oven with pizza in it, a stove top, and there is a little door leading outside. Also outside there is a menu right off the door.&nbsp;All of these items can be shown in the pictures above. Before this set can become an actual LEGO Set, I need your support. Making an account is free and easy to do! Tell your friends and family, and get them to tell their&nbsp;friends and family. Spread the word! Even if you don&#39;t really see yourself having this set, or maybe you don&#39;t like this set at all, support it anyway. Think of other people who would want this set in stores.&nbsp;If you do like it, by all means! Support it! If you can spend four hours playing video games, you can take ten minutes to create an account (don&#39;t worry it&#39;s free!) and support my LEGO Set.

I remember these cars buzzing about in big cities such as San Francisco in the 1960s. When you looked down from high-rise buildings, the streets appeared as if they were painted yellow with so many cabs. The classic rear fins along with the large hood and trunk were typical of cars of that day. Usually built with 8 cylinders, this Plymouth had great pick-up and go!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I built this model because, as a kid, I always wanted to build it with Lego pieces. I had plenty of versions of this car in my Hot Wheels and Matchbox car collections. But I never had the bricks to complete a Lego project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model will take adults back to their childhood or care-free days of the 1960s. Kids of today will be able to enjoy the retro look of the classic cars in the 1950s and 60s. They can also imagine what it would be like in the days of very large and roomy cars. And with new transportation options appearing every day like self-driving cars, the classic yellow taxi cab has become a nostalgic icon of public transportation. This model is something Lego and car enthusiasts will want on their shelves and Lego display cabinets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model can hold up to 4 minifigs! And all four doors open. The three minifigs in this set are the cab driver and a traveling couple on their vacation. Note that the husband doesn&#39;t look very happy as traveling can be both exciting and stressful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!

The Mystery Box is also used for storing small sweets inside. On the lid there is a handel where you can lift the lid from. It is built to help people find this to decorate with and store some items. It would make a great set because it helps people who have lots of stuff storing them. Hopefully you will really find this useful, fun to play with and having fun building. In this set there are 6 mini figures that are designed by me. There are some recycling stickers to stick on the sides. This is the Mystery Box! Hopefully you will like my project and support it!

This is the Workforce Around the World! It is a project dedicated to tradespeople all around the world! There are five work vehicles form 5 of the 7 continents. Antarctica was left out because they have no vehicles, and South America was left out due to not being able to find a reference photo. From left to right, there is a truck form Africa, a truck from North America, a truck from Asia, a truck from Australia, and a van from Europe. A few fellow Ideas members have been saying i only focus on US style builds. So that is how this creation all started. Fellow member Camshaft suggested this project as a solution. It can be quite educational for children too learn about other continents, countries, and cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The African work truck is green with black accents and tow mirrors. It has yellow and black warning stripes on the front bumper. In the bed, there is a water tank designed by the great Lightningtiger. Big thanks to him. The interior is basic with two black seats, speedometers,steering wheel, and a completed dash. It also has right hand steering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The North American work truck is red with light grey and black accents. It is a crew cab regular bed format. There is 4 black cupboards with grey doors and a ladder rack installed on the bed. The interior is basic with four black seats, a steering wheel, a set of speedometers, and a completed dash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Asian work truck is personally my favorite. It is yellow with black accents. It has a custom ladder rack mounted on the front and rear bumpers. The interior is really simple, with only a steering wheel, and no seats, but there will be an updated version soon. This model comes with right hand steering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Australian work truck is commonly called a Ute. It is white with black accents, and light grey bed. The front end was designed by LegoBricker. So big thanks to him. The bed has a ladder rack is &nbsp;installed into the bed. The rear bumper has a number plate on it. The interior is basic with two black seats, a steering wheel, a set of speedometers, and a completed dash. This truck also has right hand steering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European work van was suggested by fellow member CountBrickoski. It is a simple white panel van that is common in the Europe area. It is white with black accents and tow mirrors. The cabin doors and rear doors open. The van is in a medium length chassis with high roof set up. The interior has two black seats, a steering wheel, a set of speedometers, and a completed dash including one A/C vent. The cargo bay of the van has nothing in it. Tool boxes and other accessories can easily be added. On the roof, there is a ladder rack. This model features right hand steering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This set contains 726 bricks and would sell in the $75 to $100 US currency range. All models include ladders. All models also include mini figures in worker uniforms. You can keep the mini figure with their assigned vehicle, or mix and match them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you all for supporting this creation.

The choice to make exactly this model was inspired by the official set of Porsche GT3, but my way has been a bit different, as I wanted to make the car smaller.

Exactly this model could be a smaller collectible set for those who can&#39;t afford the exclusive GT3 or simply want another Porsche on their shelf. Of course, there is a lot of work to do and a huge gap between this concept and what the real sets look like (e.g. more efficient parts&#39;&nbsp;use, improved gearbox, a flat 6-engine at the back and other small&nbsp;details), but I&#39;m really interested in improving this model and will be extremely happy to see the dream come true.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feel free to vote for this project if you would like to - I&nbsp;will be very thankful to every single supporter! :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best wishes,&nbsp; _spacehopper_</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["porsche", "911", "technic", "gearbox", "car", "suspension", "red", "engine", "steering"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-19T07:17:53.000Z", "user": {"alias": "_spacehopper_", "id": 714614, "uuid": "6cf200ba-4261-4a8b-93ca-8cc094eb98a5"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "29", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "98", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-19T07:17:53.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 19, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/8f4/161/145279/2520489-o_1alsnpol6s5l6lbagpvv3190b7-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 42, "stats_views_count_short": "844"}, {"stats_days_left": 355.5500171596528, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:12.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/7c0/ea4/148012/2564301-o_1anv6dirt6u31dbj1rprgsn1hsi8-thumbnail.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 36, "published_at": "2016-07-19T07:09:59.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 6, "stats_comments_count_short": "8", "id": 148012, "user_id": 1110825, "uuid": "b229177f-d37d-43b7-b497-1bbc6f559674", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "The Jabberwocky", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 198, "body": "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One day, I was thinking of what I wanted to build.

NASA or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Yet in many cases, their contributions are&nbsp;unknown or under-appreciated &mdash; especially as women have historically struggled to gain acceptance in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\nThis proposed set celebrates five notable NASA pioneers and provides an educational building experience to help young ones and adults alike learn about the history of women in STEM. The five Women of NASA are:<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>Margaret Hamilton</strong>,<strong> </strong>computer scientist: While working at MIT under contract with NASA in the 1960s, Hamilton developed the on-board flight software for the Apollo missions to the moon. She is known for popularizing the modern concept of software.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>Katherine Johnson</strong>, mathematician and space scientist: A longtime NASA researcher, Johnson is best known for calculating and verifying trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo programs &mdash; including the Apollo 11 mission that first landed humans on the moon.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>Sally Ride</strong>, astronaut, physicist, and educator: A physicist by training, Ride became the first American woman in space in 1983. After retiring as a NASA astronaut, she founded an educational company focusing on encouraging children &mdash; especially girls &mdash; to pursue the sciences.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>Nancy Grace Roman</strong>, astronomer: One of the first female executives at NASA, Roman is known to many as the &quot;Mother of Hubble&quot; for her role in planning the Hubble Space Telescope. She also developed NASA&#39;s astronomy research program.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>Mae Jemison</strong>, astronaut, physician, and entrepreneur: Trained as a medical doctor, Jemison became the first African-American woman in space in 1992. After retiring from NASA, Jemison established a company that develops new technologies and encourages students in the sciences.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\nIn addition to a desktop frame that displays these five minifigures and their names, the set includes vignettes depicting: a famous photo of the reams of code that landed astronauts on the moon in 1969; instruments used to calculate and verify trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo missions; a microscale Hubble Space Telescope and display; and a mini space shuttle, complete with external tank and solid rocket boosters.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Thanks in advance for your support!

It was designed to plow through large obstructions and annihilate anything in its path.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Rebel Alliance's assault on Kamino in 1 BBY, Boba Fett was tasked with infiltrating the Rebel frigate Salvation. Acting under orders from Darth Vader, the bounty hunter was accompanied by a complement of specialized units, including terror troopers, specialized droids and the Terror Walker.\r\n\r\nThe Terror Walker was released onto the Salvation, and immediately began rampaging through the vessel, leveling all in its path. Its actions allowed companies of stormtroopers to access various areas of the ship and assist Boba Fett in his objective\u2014capturing Juno Eclipse.\r\n\r\nFett was ultimately successful; however, the arrival of General Rahm Kota and the clone of Galen Marek coincided with his mission, and the Terror Walker engaged Marek's clone in single combat in the ship's Core.\r\n\r\nThe Terror Walker fought against Marek's clone in the Salvation's reactor core, a battlefield that would bring about its end. Using the reactor itself to deactivate the Walker's shield, Marek was able to damage the Terror Walker and commandeer it.\r\n\r\nThe Terror Walker was rammed into the core, and proceeded to self-destruct. Its useless body was later utilized by the clone to escape the volatile area. Whatever remained of the droid was obliterated when the Salvation impacted into Timira City.\r\n\r\nThe set itself is actually very playable. Includes Marek Starkiller, The Terror Walker, and two terror droids.\r\n\r\nThat's the description, I hope you liked it and have supported.\r\n\r\n-Flowey", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["TFU", "II", "Marek", "Flowey"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-18T07:10:57.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Flowey", "id": 618240, "uuid": "14507b34-c140-4de5-9b58-abc493827095"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "10", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "31", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-18T07:10:57.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 18, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/e99/aff/144745/2510332-o_1aldegok99fh9143a9ea1q9ce-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 7, "stats_views_count_short": "274"}, {"stats_days_left": 354.54893849592594, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:11.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/641/d4f/146837/2545635-o_1an25uhv714elhfi1v81q8g15bf7-thumbnail-f9Sd5DlasXuFlA.png", "stats_supporters_count": 29, "published_at": "2016-07-18T07:08:26.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 13, "stats_comments_count_short": "8", "id": 146837, "user_id": 877811, "uuid": "4003acb5-e855-40c3-aafb-950e40873072", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Lego Bowling Alley", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 204, "body": "<p>No city is complete without a bowling alley, and this one is detailed to the last brick. &nbsp;The set comes with two staff and six guests (8 mini figures total) along with a bicycle, a motorcycle, and two cars. &nbsp;The building itself has parking for up to four cars and a sidewalk entrance with small gardens on either side. &nbsp;The roof of the structure is easily detachable and comes off as one large assembly. &nbsp;The building also has a hinged wall to open the build even more. &nbsp;Inside to bowling alley are two arcade cabinets, a check-in booth with shoe rack, shelves for bowling balls of various colors, and four lanes each with ten pins and blocks that can move up and down. &nbsp;The very back of the building is empty for a reason;

As in the original set I designed three different types of building. In main image I deliberately joined the 3 projects to give an idea of how are stylish and harmonious in a city context. The order of the images is from left to right and from top to bottom. As shown in the first picture, my design integrates seamlessly with the Corner Deli. The first building (photo from 2 to 11) is the Corner Ice Cream Shop, Fruit and Vegetables Stand. The structure is a two storey corner building composed by 520 bricks. The ground floor consists of the ice-cream parlor, from the corner where you can taste an ice cream sitting comfortably under a pretty tree and from a Vegetables small Shop. On the second floor there is an elegant living room with fireplace. <span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\"><span>The roof</span> <span>is a</span> <span>panoramic terrace</span></span>. Looking at all the images, you can see all the details that I embedded in this project. For example, at the lower floor you can see the inside of the Vegetables Store with scales and cash, while in the opposite part dedicated to Ice-cream Shop you may notice a showcase with ice cream. The colors I used are simple and quite common. The second project (picture from 12 to 19) is a Seedlings Store consists of 328 bricks. The ground floor is composed by the shop and the apartment&#39;s kitchen. Over the kitchen there is the bedroom. The roof can be removed to watch the room from above. The last construction (picture from 20 to 24) is a 2 storey small palace with corner for grilling, consisting of 268 bricks.<span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\"><span> Opening the</span> <span>little building</span> <span>you may notice</span> <span>that</span> <span>the interior</span> <span>is composed as follows</span><span>: &quot;Tiny lounge</span> <span>in the</span> <span>lower floor</span><span>, bedroom</span> <span>upstairs&quot;.

I also wanted to&nbsp;use some warning tiles on something small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think this set would go nicely with a space station or in your lego city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is my first project so please support it ;)&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["space", "launchpad"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-18T06:48:46.000Z", "user": {"alias": "legolife5449", "id": 1106149, "uuid": "26dd90cd-ef6b-4bb0-aa81-795bbe30d5eb"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "7", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "9", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-18T06:48:46.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 18, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/7b6/ae7/147758/2560471-o_1ano1jaikl0r1fi93o586e1fda7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 4, "stats_views_count_short": "86"}, {"stats_days_left": 354.5329991860995, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:12.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/2ab/2ac/147794/2561209-o_1anotbao6cu9k06pp71kmc1qht7-thumbnail-PjVX7ZadYFSqgQ.JPG", "stats_supporters_count": 35, "published_at": "2016-07-18T06:45:29.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 14, "stats_comments_count_short": "12", "id": 147794, "user_id": 228299, "uuid": "42f68dbb-5d2e-4a51-96a5-8b4cb397fd66", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Ergomatic Truck", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 237, "body": "<p>Time ago I have been asked to build a model of some Ergomatic Truck.

I know playability is a major factor but I got nostalgic and old LEGO space sets were amazing and the only thing it really mattered was that I could imagine it crossing the stars!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final Price:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s for you to speculate and LEGO to determine but I think a 50&euro; is a reasonable price given the number of bricks and the selection of pieces you get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope you like this and PLEEEASE check my other projects!

The spiked wheels and intimidating machine gun can put anyone on edge, but its sleek and dark design give it a suave and manly feel. In addition the machine gun can detach using a variety of technic pieces&nbsp;and become a completely separate ship if so desired. Since the machine gunner steers the entire motorcycle, when the ship detaches, who will drive the rest of the motorcycle? Well, when the ship detaches, a hidden cockpit is revealed with steering wheel and computer face. In addition the lone rider has a side gun and front guns at his disposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Night-Cycle is not the only thing that comes in this set. Two identical flying motorcycles are an addition to this set as well as three minifigures. The two flying motorcycles are mostly composed of a main, classic motorcycle piece with guns and other accessories attached. There are two identical minifigures also that come with the set and are meant for the flying motorcycles. The last figure is meant for the Night-Cycle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Set Components</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Night-Cycle</li>\r\n\t<li>Ninja Minifigure&nbsp;(3x)</li>\r\n\t<li>Flying Motorcycle&nbsp;(2x)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Possible Set?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Night-Cycle set would make a good official LEGO set for a variety of reasons. It is both creative and unique, not to mention clever and well built. The technic pieces for the wheels and guns make it functional and stable for easy playing. The ship that comes off the motorcycle is easily detachable and easy to put back on. This set also could be easily incorporated into a LEGO theme or just be a stand alone set. That being said, this set could be pretty challenging for the young builder but easy and fun to play with otherwise. Happy building, and please support!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["night", "dark", "black", "motorcycle", "vehicle", "flying", "ship", "machine gun", "ninja", "minifigure", "classy", "large set", "skykor"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-15T14:19:37.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Skykor", "id": 917620, "uuid": "7452bbfc-7bbe-4a9b-ae3b-525020b49396"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "19", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "38", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-15T14:19:37.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 15, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/72c/ada/147657/2558935-o_1anlfkm3o1ial1678ka51m8kqb74q-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 13, "stats_views_count_short": "233"}, {"stats_days_left": 351.0582150870139, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:12.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/608/cb8/147614/2558170-o_1ankc5nci1m60tcl4qd1vttbns7-thumbnail-ZK8U1IBp187TnQ.png", "stats_supporters_count": 65, "published_at": "2016-07-14T19:21:48.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 21, "stats_comments_count_short": "53", "id": 147614, "user_id": 1059449, "uuid": "6f045642-adb7-4020-b9f5-ab77532a01b1", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Car Parking", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 603, "body": "<p>This is a Car Parking area with 11 cars to choose&nbsp;from&nbsp;when playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three different car designs (regular, convertible with roof down, and convertible with roof up), and the cars come in many different colors.

The three concrete towers are 226 feet (69 m), 160 feet (49 m) and&nbsp; 85 feet (26 m) high. On the outside of the tallest column there are two elevators called Sky Streaks which transported people from the ground the 64 foot (19.5 m) diameter observation platforms. One Sky Streak served the lower two platforms, and a second served the double platform on the third column.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Philip Johnson, the Observation Towers were not part of his original design but added after Governor Rockefeller insisted that the New York State Pavilion be the tallest structure at the Fair.

I would expect these to be made by cutting the flexible tube to length (which is something LEGO have done with their official sets) however, I did manage to make them up using standard parts - even if it did mean using a couple of minifigure &#39;lipsticks&#39;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like this Architecture set then please support and let your friends know about it too.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Fair", "Saucer", "observation towers", "astro-view", "sky-streak", "1964", "new york", "USA"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-14T16:37:17.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Eiffleman", "id": 859077, "uuid": "f6cc0079-5c7d-4086-9816-09da85d0de58"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "19", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "52", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-14T16:37:17.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 14, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/d75/b42/147281/2556769-o_1anj0lms76rqjlerbu1hno1r11e-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 19, "stats_views_count_short": "234"}, {"stats_days_left": 350.91756537818287, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:12.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/42a/ec6/147534/2556433-o_1animiqqebuirfj0l1t21974g-thumbnail-uBPbLZX5ECsHpQ.jpeg", "stats_supporters_count": 13, "published_at": "2016-07-14T15:59:16.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 10, "stats_comments_count_short": "14", "id": 147534, "user_id": 1109902, "uuid": "e7ea3130-5a9f-435a-b91c-0c16c45f8082", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Lava Throne", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 175, "body": "<p>Do you know any king of&nbsp;lava, is he real?

I worked hard to capture the show to the finest details! Since in the show there are Saloon doors, I used them as the front door rather then the Dutch doors used on the show! I was happy the BOW on top of the store worked out just fine! Minnie, just as in the show has a work table to make her beautiful bows! She even provides cologne, lipstick and a brush for her clients to freshen up! The cat, Figaro and bird, Cockoo Loca from the show are included and Cockoo Loca is exact right down to her purple ribbon! The cabinet that houses more ribbons for sale has been stylized and Minnie is wearing her shop dress complete with an apron! The ribbons are on display in the shop&#39;s window as well as on the spinning rack! (I am showing both&nbsp;types of windows: clear and light blue transparent.) I loved the way I also stylized the planters on each end of the shop as well as the mirror! I owe a lot to this design to the Disney Princess Pets series I got a lot of its basics from it! I added flags to round it out! This set has plenty of &quot;play value&quot; a shopping bag to collect your purchase! A cash register and a drawer to store the money. Minnie even has a mug for here iced tea! I hope you enjoy it. It would make a great play set not only for girls but boys as well!

If you want to, you can check the first one here <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/145354\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/145354.</a> Basically the idea is to make a whole series of Microfighters with a little bit of more pieces than the Lego series, which is around 100 per set. So I thing there&#39;s no surprise here, when I tell you that the <strong>X</strong> is for &quot;e<strong>X</strong>tended&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>V-19 Torrent starfighter</strong> was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. Its armament consisted of two laser cannons (one on each wingtip) and two concussion missile launchers and also, the V-19 was unique in that it had two pairs of folding airfoils (S-foils) that gave the ship added maneuverability and the lower, hinged S-foils coupled with enhanced engines made the <strong>V-19</strong> an exceptional vertical take-off and landing fighter. So it comes with no surprise that my model had to incorporate those features, even at microfighter scale, with minimum use of pieces and as always... look good!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every single s-foils rotates from landing to flight position and it wasn&#39;t so easy to do as I expected at first. Incorporating the engines in the front s-foils forced me to use technic elements (and that&#39;s bad because it makes the pieces counter fly like a rocket) and especially the rear s-foil, where I had to chose the right pieces, so I could be really sure it didn&#39;t got stuck anywhere... but it&#39;s done and just using 151 pieces. I thing it looks good. Do you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments, <span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\"><span>suggestions</span></span> and ideas are welcome and I also hope you like it and support it.

Needless to say, the reviews have skyrocketed since its release in May. This project contains around 300 pieces, and you will see why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this project, I have&nbsp;put in every detail I could find from the game to put into this set. If you take a look at the first picture underneath the title screen, you will see that the project is based off of the first level of the game, where the player moves in with his mother. This is where the players start making videos and start gaining subscribers. In this photo, I have carefully added a closet for extra clothes, a few shelves, and the computer desk.&nbsp;The second picture shows both sides of the room, just to show you that I carefully put everything I could find together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At some point, the player would have to get a game console to play on the television. In the third picture, I built an LCD television that has a custom decal printed on, using a window piece as the television screen. (The same goes for the bed.) On the TV stand, there is&nbsp;a piece that can be used as a game controller, so the player would be able to play console games on the television, instead of the computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, at some point, the computer is going to break. Now, if you were the player, who would you call to fix it? That&#39;s right, you would have to call the repair man, who can be seen in the fourth picture. This photo also features the computer desk with the swivel chair which I built using just four pieces. You can use the repair man to fix the computer whenever it breaks down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let&#39;s take a look at the minifigures who will be featured in this project. We have the repair man, the mother, the Youtuber (You can name him whatever you want in the comments if you wish), and two of the Youtuber&#39;s friends, Jack and Jenna. These minifigures can be seen in the last photo. I tried to get every little detail on these minifigures as I did for the entire room itself. However, projects have their flaws, meaning that this project is gonna be updated once in a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please support this project so that it becomes an official LEGO product. I have worked on this project for a whole month, and I would not want it to go to waste from here. There will be updates for this project, so be sure to check back here to see if one has shown. Until the update, thank you for reading, and I hope you support!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["youtube", "game", "pewdiepie", "jacksepticeye", "tycoon", "simulator", "sims", "thesims"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-11T12:54:40.000Z", "user": {"alias": "spiderninja101", "id": 647053, "uuid": "267e11ca-cebf-48e4-b7ac-8daabbdf76d5"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "15", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "46", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-11T12:54:40.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 11, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/22d/966/146905/2552725-o_1ancumvlj1sco1e091bd0l5atb7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 43, "stats_views_count_short": "523"}, {"stats_days_left": 347.7888419282986, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:11.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/256/44b/147141/2550456-o_1an8t9uc31nas19891ei2b181tj77-thumbnail-S81k_bAIhp39rA.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 26, "published_at": "2016-07-11T12:53:55.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 9, "stats_comments_count_short": "14", "id": 147141, "user_id": 593307, "uuid": "1f8fc371-0170-47c3-ad4f-fa809b0eea49", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Alice in Wonderland: One Golden Afternoon", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 199, "body": "<p>On a golden afternoon, young Alice follows a White Rabbit, who disappears down a nearby rabbit hole.

There is a Jurassic World logo on each door.&nbsp;The front grille has the bullbar bumper, and features the Mercedes logo. The rear of the car has a spare tire affixed to the back hatch. The roof and side windows also come off to access the interior.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since in LDD you cannot put decals on dinosaurs, I didn&#39;t add any, but in my mind this set would come with a guard minifig and a velociraptor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any feedback is much appreciated!

The crystals are mined from the mountains by a miner. A scientist then inserts it into the generator, and it starts to suck the power from it. The power goes through the generator and into the launcher. Another scientist checks over the generator, making sure everything is working, and one more locks the target and presses the button that makes the bomb go. A maintenance man fixes any issues with his tools and two guards protect the generator from peeking eyes. A security camera atop a mound of rocks watches over the whole thing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The set includes 7 minifigures and around 20 accessories. It comes with about 10 crystals.

Here, we can get a peek at the lives of such Jedi as Ki-Adi-Mundi, Ahsoka Tano, and more. Shall we take a look?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ki-Adi-Mundi&rsquo;s dorm: A wise Cerean Jedi, and part of the Jedi Council, Mundi would no doubt need his own place of rest and meditation. In his dorm, you see a bed, two weapons on display, a jar, and a meditation pool. The meditation pool was customized to Mundi&#39;s noble desires. Behind him is a little pump that drips a drop of water a minute. He does so because each drop of water reminds him of a Jedi that fell in battle, which were many in the Clone Wars (<a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ki-Adi-Mundi\">http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ki-Adi-Mundi</a> , Personality and Traits). Also, there is a place to put his lightsaber. For his lightsaber crystal, he uses a traditional Kasha crystal, a force enhanced crystal that was used as a tool for meditation by the Cerean people. He uses the crystal to help him clear his mind, both in meditation, and in battle. (Mundi would come with a blue blade to add to his hilt.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aayla Secura&#39;s dorm: In it are four pieces of furniture: two lamps, one bed, and one table. On the table is a computer and a holo-disc. She has no real bed, but instead sleeps on a cushion (green plate piece) with an extra-cushioned pillow. (Secura would come with two lightsabers, one green, and the other blue.)<br />\r\n&nbsp;To produce the lighting effect, the white pieces in the lamps glow in the dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahsoka Tano&rsquo;s dorm: Although the last episode of Clone Wars, Season 5 had Ahsoka moving out, I still think that people would be interested in this dorm. She has a bed, a table, a droid repair platform, and a computer for research. Her drive to become more like her master, Anakin, has led her to practice repairing droids,&nbsp;to help her understand how Anakin thinks.&nbsp;Her bed has no mattress, but still has a pillow. (Ahsoka would come with both of her lightsaber, one green, the other a yellowish-green.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mace Windu&rsquo;s dorm: Mace Windu doesn&#39;t ask for much. He has a large, round chair, a bed, a desk chair and a desk. On the desk is a computer. The bed comes with a cushion, a pillow, and a blanket. Right now, you can see him meditating on the chair. (Mace would come with his purple lightsaber.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those are all the dorms. Outside each dorm you can see a hall. Here, you can see that they can be connected, allowing a long line of dorms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the Temple, there are many other Jedi who have their own dorms. How about a place for Jocasta Nu, the librarian? Maybe she&#39;d have a computer, and a series of bookshelves for reading? Maybe she&#39;d even take a Holocron to seek knowledge from past Jedi. How about Gungi, the Wookie Padawan that travelled to Ilum with Ahsoka and other Younglings to get their lightsaber crystals? How many artifacts would decorate his room, to help him feel at home? Or maybe you can introduce your own character, with their own style and culture? Whatever you do, the options are endless for this set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for viewing this set. I hope you enjoyed, and will check out my other sets. May the Force be with you.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Star Wars", "Jedi", "Temple"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-11T06:21:56.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Xendor", "id": 247959, "uuid": "4b3bc6ac-ceb6-4dab-bd55-2f1737a46452"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "7", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "16", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-11T06:21:56.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 11, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/ce4/289/147116/2550116-o_1an8hipqtkcgj45khi9dq1j1ne-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 4, "stats_views_count_short": "417"}, {"stats_days_left": 347.5161307703125, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:11.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/c05/0e4/147122/2550199-o_1an8jvib217qvg963b21djks1a9-thumbnail-t5CQQrSZLkMwRQ.png", "stats_supporters_count": 55, "published_at": "2016-07-11T06:21:13.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 17, "stats_comments_count_short": "47", "id": 147122, "user_id": 1010810, "uuid": "e751f378-0d9f-4d36-b74f-bc1d66f99a0e", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Donuts!!!", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 265, "body": "<p>Hey guys!!

They had gone up there&nbsp;Looking for their friend Boot, who was searching for an old treasure that was hidden there many years before. Little did they know, they had walked right into and ambush! Humongous venooses (Giant twelve legged arachnids) repelled from the attic rafters, surrounding the group of friends.&nbsp;Soon after a gigantic silvery venoos caught Dilly with a line of thick sticky webbing. Dod tried throwing gold coins at the beast, but it did not back down. It just kept pulling Dilly closer until she was only a few feet from&nbsp;its huge fangs. Dod tried hopelessly to free her, but with nothing to sever the line with, his efforts were in vain. But then, when Dod was about to give up, Boot charged out of the shadows (Wearing an old suit of armor) and slayed the Silvery venoos. He then threw a pile of rotten bones in the remaining venooses&#39; direction, this kept their attention long enough for the threesome to make their escape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SET INCLUDES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Detailed attic wall and connecting rafters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Fully pose-able giant silvery venoos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. two pose-able venooses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.

His company (&ldquo;<strong>Lazareth</strong>&rdquo;) is based in Annecy, a beautiful little town located in the French Alps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of his last creation is called <strong>LM 847</strong> &hellip; If I had to chose just two words to describe Ludovic Lazareth&rsquo;s LM 847, I would probably say &ldquo;<em><strong>Beautiful Beast</strong></em>&rdquo;. LM 847 is indeed a motorcycle (yes it is !) with four independent wheels and powered by the 4.7-liter, 32-valve V8 Maserati engine !! This amazing engine unleaches no less than 470 horsepower &hellip; that&rsquo;s probably the reason why Ludovic Lazareth made the choice to transplant two huge tires on the back of his LM 847. Each rear wheel is connected to the Maserati engine and is suspended independently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to this complex system, when one wheel moves up, the other one moves down, and this allows the bike to lean &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same two tires are found at the front end but this time the system is more complex.

This model before you is a <strong>378-piece</strong> representation of a medieval watermill! It includes <strong>three minifigures, an armored horse</strong>&nbsp;and a host of <strong>interactivity and play features</strong>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exterior of the mill is worn and drab, with various foliage adorning the exterior. I tried to use a variety of round bricks and dark-colored tiles to give the walls an authentic look and pattern. The mill wheel also runs over a small stream to simulate how real-life ones used to operate!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top floor features a <strong>small catapult that can launch provided ammo, which in this case are small &quot;boulders&quot; to fend off the intruders</strong>! A gear next to the catapult relates to a feature described later on.&nbsp;There is also <strong>plenty of room for at least two figures to stand, and a ladder that leads to the middle floor</strong>, which is the miller figure&#39;s blacksmith shop. It <strong>includes an anvil, hammer, and furnace to simulate the actual forging of an iron blade</strong>! The spire in the middle is connected to the gear on the top floor and is decorated with textured pieces to disguise the Technic axle that protrudes through the floor. What does it do? It connects to a gear system that, <strong>when the top gear is turned, rotates the mill wheel</strong> to simulate its collection of the water below! The <strong>system is hidden within the cellar, </strong>which in turn is hidden by a well-disguised<strong> panel that hinges open and closed for easy access</strong>. <strong>Also in the cellar is the coveted prize that the evil knights are after- the miller&#39;s treasure- a fabulous wealth of jewls and gold</strong>! A lone <strong>black-widow spider</strong> is the only line of defense once the panel is breached!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would love to see this set make it to the rare 10,000 votes and become an official product! I believe it <strong>has potential by being affordable and having many features</strong> that kids would love to play with. The <strong>immense detail could please adult collectors who would prefer a display piece</strong> instead!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please share and spread the word so we can get this on shelves!</strong></p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["knights", "mill", "watermill", "castle", "blacksmith", "medieval", "building", "old", "treasure"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-07T12:14:16.000Z", "user": {"alias": "KyloRen", "id": 867735, "uuid": "11a63622-dfee-4413-af61-a77feb6f0d7b"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "25", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "68", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-07T12:14:16.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 07, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/0a3/c27/146836/2545619-o_1an250ma81nqq1fsavjat6nm4s7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 16, "stats_views_count_short": "346"}, {"stats_days_left": 343.5257626189005, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:11.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/2f4/bb9/146824/2545431-o_1an1mifoul3i17mj1cam1ic9gl7-thumbnail-caJMQU3ptEhPuw.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 40, "published_at": "2016-07-07T06:35:06.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 13, "stats_comments_count_short": "18", "id": 146824, "user_id": 734654, "uuid": "2f56ba17-035a-4a5d-ae3f-5be62fd2109f", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Pool Table", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 249, "body": "<p>This is a miniature pool table made out of Legos.

"<p>\u4e00\u3001</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The T-rex is the apex predator in the Cretaceous age, and the most perfect masterpiece evolution has ever managed to accomplish. Because 65 million years after its extinction, it is still the biggest and most powerful carnivore ever walked the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I first watch&nbsp;<em>Jurassic Park</em>, I was immediately captivated by the power and beauty of the T-rex, and hopelessly fell in love with her. And what beats watching a T-rex movie? Building one yourself! At 59 cm length and 930 grams weight, This model is possibly the world*&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>largest</strong>&nbsp;posable T-rex that stands on its own. * LEGO world :-)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&nbsp;like it, and want to build one yourself, pleas&nbsp;<strong>support</strong>&nbsp;me :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand&nbsp;<strong>thanks</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u4e8c\u3001Features:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. It grew bigger as the building went on, for we are all greedy in the detail department. As a result, at a certain moment, It suddenly hit me that this thing may never&nbsp;be able to stand on its own when finished, and that would be an ultimate bummer (Yes, it&rsquo;s my second MOC, I never knew LEGO was so heavy!). But due to a&nbsp;technique (mixel joints served as tendons), a lot of time and effort put into banlancing, and many compromises made to aesthetics, the completed T-rex&nbsp;<strong>stands on its own</strong>. (It may not pose a problem for digital building, but I consider this the No.1 feature of this build.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Play features: This beast is not only a display piece, It is moderately&nbsp;<strong>posable</strong>&nbsp;thanks to a lot of joints. And it has to be from the conveiving because there are so many cool postures and it would be a waste of bricks if it ends up to be just a statue. Again, aesthetics has to give way&hellip; to gaps. But the very essence of LEGO saves the day again: with a few parts (modules) added or removed, the gaps left by maneuvers can be covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Sturdy</strong>.&nbsp;Every time I had to choose between appearance and sturdiness, I chose the latter, for which I think is a virtue of official sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. I try to get the&nbsp;proportions&nbsp;as&nbsp;<strong>real</strong>&nbsp;as possible.&nbsp;Oftentimes I see a T-rex MOC, the head is over-sized to stress the beast&#39;s ferociousness and the feet are disproportionately&nbsp;large to increase stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Stud-Not-On-Top</strong>&nbsp;design, and all&nbsp;&ldquo;<strong>legal</strong>&rdquo; LEGO parts and techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more Hi-Def&nbsp;pics go to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://flic.kr/s/aHskCpW3Se\">https://flic.kr/s/aHskCpW3Se</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u4e09\u3001</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9738\u738b\u9f99\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u80fd\u770b\u61c2\u6c49\u5b57\uff0c\u5c31\u66f4\u5f97\u652f\u6301\u6211\u5566\uff01\u8c22\u8c22\uff01:-)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Jurassic", "Cretaceous", "creature", "animal", "tyrannosaurus", "t-rex", "triceratops", "Arctic", "dinosaur", "posable"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-06T06:40:16.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Gezheng Qu", "id": 961728, "uuid": "cdc79457-d65e-48b6-afc1-1db5ab84e490"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "35", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "175", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-06T06:40:16.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 06, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/56f/1b3/146539/2540779-o_1amqq2mvc1rkt1dfnthg7f6aas7-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 48, "stats_views_count_short": "967"}, {"stats_days_left": 342.52406712733796, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:11.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/bcf/637/146517/2543274-o_1amtvgoopfkv1rkb15u01klk1f2d7-thumbnail-JN0TGWKCvL_8Bg.png", "stats_supporters_count": 33, "published_at": "2016-07-06T06:32:40.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 14, "stats_comments_count_short": "28", "id": 146517, "user_id": 1010810, "uuid": "840edf9c-70da-4ab5-a69a-91fb1e2bf631", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Apple Watch", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 266, "body": "<p>Hey guys!!! I&#39;m MattTheCat12 (although if I can, I will soon be changing my username to MattTheWaffleCat (I just now found out that I can&#39;t do that, like 20 minutes later so just ignore that)) and I&#39;m back with another project that I have literally worked on almost nonstop, all day today!&nbsp;If you haven&#39;t already read the title, it&#39;s an Apple Watch!! The pictures in which there is a screen on the screen are just representations of what stickers might go well with the model based on the real thing and if you just build it without any stickers, the screen will just be blank. I did however create the screens on my own using Pages, Preview, and Powerpoint (so I guess the 3 P&#39;s that I use almost constantly) so none of the pictures are from the internet, so Lego Ideas, you can&#39;t tell me that you&#39;re not going to approve my project because I can only use my own pictures because I totally did, they&#39;re just based off of actual pictures. Anyway, the first picture uploaded is my lego recreation of the Apple Watch website (<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/watch/\">http://www.apple.com/watch/</a>). You&#39;ll see what I mean if you go to that website. Anyway, I&#39;ll continue talking about the actual project. It has a part count of 55 bricks and is pretty simple to make. I really think this project should become a real Lego Set because it&#39;s fun for kids (like me) who don&#39;t have Apple Watches. I remember when I was younger making DSs (if anyone else remembers when those were popular)&nbsp;and Laptops and whatnot and I loved it so I think this project would be great for young kids as well as adults who want an Apple Watch but don&#39;t feel like buying one!! I thouroughly enjoyed designing this project and I think that if it becomes a Lego Set, everyone who builds it will have fun as well.&nbsp;Well everybody, I guess&nbsp;that&#39;s&nbsp;all for today (and tomorrow)&nbsp;but as always, remember to click that Support button kind of in that direction--&gt; and let&#39;s go for a goal of maybe, I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s see if we can get at least 16 supporters, shall we!! If we can get to 500 (or if this project Expires) I&#39;ll put the instructions in an update!!

The basic&nbsp;idea of the show consists of amateur chefs selected from across the country who compete in various cooking challenges. Celebrity chef judges critique the contestants&#39; dishes, and contestants are successively eliminated until&nbsp;one is crowned winner and awarded a MasterChef trophy. MasterChef is currently produced in over 45 countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, South Africa, Italy, Portugal, Spain, South Korea, and Turkey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe present project is inspired by the original U.S. Version of the show, featuring celebrity chef judge Gordon Ramsay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease check out some of my other projects!<br />\r\nVintage Tram https://ideas.lego.com/projects/119603<br />\r\nSan Francisco Cable Car https://ideas.lego.com/projects/125350<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuilt using LEGO Digital Designer, this project is divided into 3 main modules: the kitchen, the stage, and the pantry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Kitchen</strong>&nbsp;(206 pieces)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe kitchen module is where contestants feverishly prepare their concoctions to try to impress the judges. It features a total of six stations, divided into three rows of two. Each station includes a cooktop, oven, drawer, counter with cutting board, storage space, as well as a shared sink. The front row also showcases&nbsp;a backlit &quot;MasterChef&quot; signage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Stage</strong> (94 pieces)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe stage module is where the judges&nbsp;preside for much of the show, are where contestants present their dishes to be critiqued. It features a raised platform with a back glass wall. Both showcase the MasterChef logo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Pantry</strong> (413 pieces)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe well-stocked pantry module is where contestants pick and gather&nbsp;their ingredients for their creations. It features a centre station full of various fruits and vegetables, as&nbsp;well as a selection of fresh herbs. Along the side wall&nbsp;are&nbsp;two shelves full of sauces, spices,&nbsp;and other useful ingredients. Lastly, along the back wall is a table of&nbsp;breads, a large refrigerator, as well as MasterChef logo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Minifigs</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe judge minifigs are based on the celebrity&nbsp;TV personalities featured in the original U.S. version of the show, namely Gordon Ramsay, Graham Elliot, and Joe Bastianich. All&nbsp;have custom torsos and faces&nbsp;to reflect their trademark look and style of attire. The contestants, meanwhile,&nbsp;are wearing the MasterChef&nbsp;apron represented by custom torsos and leg prints.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComments, questions, and constructive feedback of this model is greatly appreciated!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow me on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/kevinszetolego<br />\r\nSee more Ideas and Non-Ideas images on my Flickr https://www.flickr.com/photos/dreamcatcher1979/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for viewing!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Master", "Chef", "Cooking", "Reality", "TV", "Show", "Ramsay", "Minifigure", "Entree", "Desert", "Food", "Restaurant"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-05T06:36:11.000Z", "user": {"alias": "kevinszeto", "id": 581618, "uuid": "d0c6df0f-fc1d-4e3d-a802-d03e20648274"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "88", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "403", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-05T06:36:11.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 05, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/413/5ba/146215/2536041-o_1amjb2dj4ctq1dbci035vv1vbe7-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 46, "stats_views_count_short": "6k"}, {"stats_days_left": 341.5261136211805, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:11.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/15a/083/146600/2541891-o_1amrv10t21e9l13d4ae41sus2sv7-thumbnail-3Kkl1GpoHcvFmw.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 57, "published_at": "2016-07-05T06:35:37.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 20, "stats_comments_count_short": "14", "id": 146600, "user_id": 1106200, "uuid": "ddde1b13-ee18-452f-8d0c-ce4cb6306cec", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Reclaimed Union Pacific Coach", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 492, "body": "<p>A Union Pacific coach that was at the end of it&#39;s life has been reclaimed and reused as a road dinner.

The set would include the&nbsp;<em>Elf on the Shelf</em> Lego Minifigure character with multiple facial options to represent gender and ethnic origins.&nbsp;The setting&nbsp;is&nbsp;a living room&nbsp;with a Christmas tree, gifts, fireplace, dog (optional),&nbsp;and holiday garland indoors. The outdoor setting of the room displays holiday lights as one would see on any home.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Elf on the Shelf", "Christmas", "Holiday", "Elf"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-05T06:34:53.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Tdpck", "id": 1040460, "uuid": "6407ff99-94ea-40db-8781-f73b0d57ac42"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "14", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "38", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-05T06:34:53.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 05, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/cdd/d25/146589/2541772-o_1amroqh97a9o1vdtv3f1qa61glkc-full.JPG", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 25, "stats_views_count_short": "732"}, {"stats_days_left": 341.52320803281253, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:11.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/3d6/ed7/146278/2542173-o_1amsh87ct19qs41u1mcf1tmn1mfec-thumbnail-YzZTiszm0CvzyA.png", "stats_supporters_count": 20, "published_at": "2016-07-05T06:31:26.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 13, "stats_comments_count_short": "9", "id": 146278, "user_id": 909862, "uuid": "b45ea52d-9ea5-4707-a991-a56f9b2accf9", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Animal Crossing Town Hall", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 252, "body": "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>*Not endorsed by Nintendo or affiliated companies!*</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Animal Crossing is an amazing game. Its gameplay, colorful graphics, and fun characters just add to its charm. When I played it for the first time, I was pulled in. And that&#39;s where I got the idea to make this set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This set is a recreation of the Town Hall from New Leaf. The right side of the building swings out so you have more room to play with it. You can also take off the roof to look inside the building and play with minifigures inside of the Town Hall. There is also an apple tree nearby with apples to pick so Villager can go sell them at Re-Tail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The set comes with:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Villager</li>\r\n\t<li>Isabelle</li>\r\n\t<li>Apple Tree</li>\r\n\t<li>Town Hall</li>\r\n\t<li>Town Flag</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two minifigs have no new molds or pieces. It was very hard to find a hair piece that looks like Isabelle&#39;s, but I did find one. Both minifigures are have short legs instead of normal legs because the characters are short in the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope every one of you Animal Crossing fans out there support this set. It means a lot to me!</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div><span style=\"color:rgb(75, 75, 75); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:20px\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["animal crossing", "animals", "villager", "isabelle", "nintendo", "town hall", "building", "animal crossing new leaf", "new leaf", "apples", "apple tree", "clock", "mayor"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-05T06:31:26.000Z", "user": {"alias": "ShossMan_2658", "id": 909862, "uuid": "20c17db6-30ed-46c8-9cb8-e66031b29aec"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "13", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "20", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-05T06:31:26.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 05, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/3d6/ed7/146278/2542173-o_1amsh87ct19qs41u1mcf1tmn1mfec-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 9, "stats_views_count_short": "252"}, {"stats_days_left": 341.5220735958333, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:11.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/721/cfc/146483/2539719-o_1ampai87i1t07nqvr287qjqpt8-thumbnail-XEr_Ub8rOp5aeQ.JPG", "stats_supporters_count": 136, "published_at": "2016-07-05T06:29:48.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 37, "stats_comments_count_short": "30", "id": 146483, "user_id": 981039, "uuid": "cd7ba7fe-5a74-4a59-9c59-c50531717b4c", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Mini Ball Loop 08", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 941, "body": "<p>https://youtu.be/zWzXTBlQfy4</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Is a LEGO Marble Mini Loop.

It is not based on any building in particular but it&#39;s meant to be one of LEGO&#39;s. I added the giant studs on the roof so it looks more LEGO. This building has four main rooms, plus a hallway. The rooms are: The Check In/ Waiting-room, the Building-room, the Tech-room, (also known as the &#39;Nerd-room&#39;) and the Business office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <strong><em>check In/ Waiting-room </em></strong>This is the room where LEGO fans get customer service and the employees can check in. If someone is already occupying the desk lady, that is when the wait comes into the Waiting-room. But there are nice couches to wait on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the<strong><em> Building-room </em></strong>all the Master Builders build and create LEGO sets. Right now they&#39;re in the middle of creating a castle. They also have a couple finished LEGO sets on the wall to give them inspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <strong><em>Tech-room</em></strong> or otherwise known as the Nerd-room the Nerd Squad works. They work on Lego digital designer creating different ideas for The Master Builders to build. The Nerd Squad also covers any other tech related jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <em><strong>Business Office</strong></em> the business men and investors work out all the business issues including: Stock, Sales, Advertising, Marketing and much more Business stuff. In words of Unikitty,&rdquo;It&rsquo;s just business, business, Numbers...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This set would include 1 Desk lady, 2 Master Builders, 2 Nerds, and 2 Business men. Other cool things this set would have: A spinning door, 6 extra-large bricks, 5 mini LEGO set boxes, 5 computers (2 have LDD, 2 are off, and 1 has a random desktop) a pizza, pizza boxes, 3 mini action figures, a mini LEGO castle, plenty of mugs, a coffee machine and much much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also if anyone was wondering the Piece count, it has 2750 pieces, but that is just how I built it. If it became a real set then The Master Builders would build it differently and could probably bring down the piece count to a little over 2,000 bricks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you like my set and I really hope you will support it. Also please comment and tell me what you think. I&#39;m really interested in what your favorite room is.

The offset wheels also help to give the model the unruly and awkward rolling movement that enabled the Tilt-a-Whirls to completely jar the inner ears of countless fair goers.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["80's", "80's movies", "Explorers", "ethan hawke", "river pheonix", "goonies", "jerry goldsmith", "joe dante", "childhood", "nostalgia"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-04T08:01:12.000Z", "user": {"alias": "NostalgiaClown", "id": 651545, "uuid": "1452976d-2933-4746-8177-71bcc413f03b"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "10", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "26", "support_ending_at": "2017-07-04T08:01:12.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 04, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/785/459/146230/2535730-o_1amio1hs43ug1d74n5vhem17rn7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 6, "stats_views_count_short": "266"}, {"stats_days_left": 340.57365720626154, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:11.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/c22/467/146508/2540131-o_1ampqn2931spj1f79su7hf8dd9e-thumbnail-H3M1SSN5r_-y5A.png", "stats_supporters_count": 46, "published_at": "2016-07-04T07:44:05.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 14, "stats_comments_count_short": "11", "id": 146508, "user_id": 743963, "uuid": "1c2081d2-75a0-4f39-b3a6-409dc9aa4149", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Japanese Cherry and Bamboo Shadow Box", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 246, "body": "<p>I&#39;ve recently been buying a few pieces of Japanese style art and thought it might make a&nbsp;nice project to attempt to create something similar in more than 2 dimensions. I kept this thin so that it would appeal to people who would like to display it, but it also has various levels of depth. The green background is meant to represent a patch of bamboo. <span>Other than the tree, the builder would have a lot of freedom in how to arrange the tiles.&nbsp;</span>The Japanese characters, according to Google Translate at least, say &quot;Life&quot;. I was also very inspired by the various little bonsai projects people have put on here. Creating a convincing tree is a fun challenge. It has about 675 pieces, but a lot of that is the frame which could be simplified considerably. Anyway, if you like it, please take a second to support it and view my page for a lot of different models that also need your support.

Each set sits on a 32 x 32 tan baseplate. The roof easily comes right off to allow for play inside the ranch house. It even has a surprise hidden under the floorboards of the house. The corral comes complete with fencing, cattle, a gate, and even a shovel (to clean up the cattle dung!)

The third and last&nbsp;one is the little masterpiece of every good gardener: <strong>climbing vegetables</strong>.<br />\r\nThere are bamboo beams that create a sort of framework where climbing plants&nbsp;grow by themselves or tied by the gardener. In this garden I inserted&nbsp;<strong>cherry tomatoes</strong> and <strong>climbing zucchini</strong> (courgette): i used Lego parts for plants&nbsp;and fruits, LEGO cherry for tomatoes and LEGO sausage for zucchini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CABIN AND TOOLS</strong><br />\r\nTHere&#39;s a cabin, a wood and brick cabin, where gardeners put all their instruments.&nbsp;Infact a good gardener needs a lot of tools.

It is a building that&nbsp;designs and manufactures&nbsp;newspapers. I was inspired by Brick Adjuster, multiple online sources, and most noticeably, Town Hall (10224). The front exterior shows a lot of brick-work and there is a sign that spells out the word &quot;NEWS&quot;. In the back, there is a loading dock and many tall windows. On the first floor, there is a visitor section, newspaper conveyor belt, and&nbsp;an elevator. On the second floor, there are&nbsp;five unique desks and a large printer. The third floor it is the meeting room where reporters discuss what they think should be in the newspaper. In that room, there is a long table cluttered with paper and a white board. Finally on the roof, there is a skylight that bring light into the third floor and three satellite dishes. Also, there is a ladder that goes all the way from the roof to the&nbsp;first floor. The minifigures in this set consist of two laborers, two reporters, and the boss. Lastly, the second floor is able to be stacked on top of itself to expand the building.

countless Adventures of the Batman in his Comics and also his Movies.<br />\r\nA reliable Vehicle that is packed with lots of technological Innovations and Abilities, ready to drive into the Night of Gotham to chase the Evil.</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Model:</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">It is almost one year ago, that I created my own and former UCS Batmobile Project that is counting its last days on LEGO Ideas before getting out of the race. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">It was a nice experience to see how the new design works on people and LEGO Lovers and in exchange I earned their feedback, which was very positive.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">This year I saw the trailer for the new LEGO Batman Movie 2017 and was inspired to recreate the Batmobile I made and to see what can I upgrade, make better and optimize.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Result is something that I am really proud of and so I present you the new UCS LEGO Batmobile 2016 Project for LEGO Ideas.</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">As in my early project mentioned, this Model is a Tribute to the designer and makers of the LEGO 7784 Model, the model that I most love from LEGO and which is in my opinion the best ever! </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">A true Model Legend!&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">What is New? </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">This Batmobile comes with a totally upgraded Chassis.<br />\r\nIt has new Bodyparts like the Sidepods and Front- and Sidecanons. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Working Frontcanons and posable Sidecannons for displaying. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Some parts like the canopy was optimized for a better design without disturbing the eye. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">It is more stable around the front because of the parts change at the Frontwheels.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Totally it looks like one of the Batmobiles of the legendary Comics.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">I created this model as an Collectors Edition and like the 7784 it doesn&rsquo;t come with Minifigures.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Please enjoy the Pictures and don&rsquo;t forget to Support this outstanding Project to reach the 10.000

Now I have already had the other Tradesman&#39;s Truck, but hey, a guy can&#39;t do a job all alone! So, this can be his co-workers truck. It is roughly based on the 2009 Ford F-250 Utility bed. it is a white two door long bed version. Under the hood is a powerful diesel engine to tow whatever trailer you need to get the job done. Sadly forgot the hitch, but watch for it in an update. The front end stays really close to the original F-250 look. The cab is&nbsp;really basic with dark grey seats, and black accessories. There are also black tow mirrors. The bed is&nbsp;mainly basic with only 4 built in tool boxes. Two of which have drawers to sort your tools, and two regular storage bins. There is a ladder rack mounted a top the utility bed with an extension ladder, and an orange strobe light. There are two taillight and two turn signals mounted on the bed. There is also room in between the two tool boxes to haul materials for your job from a 2x4 plate to a 1x16 brick, the&nbsp;possibilities are endless! This set contains 149 brick, and as usual would sell in the $20 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks all for supporting!

Every morning and evening, these big and sturdy vehicles carries thousands of kids to and back from school, supporting the traffic of the youth. They are so iconic, that once you see these yellow machines, you know that they are not just ordinary buses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>[Design of the model]</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design took several month total to complete. We are trying to build it as resemblance to a real one as possible. We did a lot of the real dimension to scale analysis, and decided to make one that is the same scale as minifigures, (thus could go along) and as accurate as possible. Moreover, there are several tough points, different from regular buses, such as stop signs working arm, curved top, narrow working doors etc. (so many fun parts!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily they all came along with the new fantastic model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Key part, the working stop sign:</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To design the working stop sign takes a long time. We tried most of the designs, but it turns out that they may stands out from the outer shell too far and thus not realistic. We want a design that when the sign withdraws it merged to the outer shell as close as possible, like the real bus, that&rsquo;s why we finally chose this new design of the stop sign. Please see pictures for details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>[Model Details]</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model comes with the authentic outlook, any memories from the past?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Sadly, more than half of them are already retired, becoming part of our precious childhood moments, that&rsquo;s why with your support this could be one that stands on your book shelf to refresh your memories!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The details:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Iconic Front</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Outside details, windows (see them open?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Real Engine compartment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Side storage compartment (6 big and 1 small, and we have put something useful inside)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Windows and doors</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Extra mirror details</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Special stop lights</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Authentic interior details</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(Play with) Moving parts:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Adjustable mirrors,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Front safety shield/bar</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Emergency exits open (both sides)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Luggage compartment opens \uff08there are 7! \uff09</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Front door opens as real bus</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Real engine compartment opens!

(current LEGO price per piece is around 9c) Hopefully with the mass production of LEGO, it could be further lowered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>[Please Support!

(source wikipedia)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>For this build I listed&nbsp;all the spaces and also the vehicles&nbsp;Batman normally uses and planned the cave accordingly. The whole build centered around a 48 x 48 base plate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Incorporated the following spaces:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>1) Library with the sliding door to the batpoles. Used chairs istead of just poles that can be triggered to&nbsp;slide down to the cave.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>2) The command center, with three monitors. With an option to mount a larger monitor on top of it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>3) A laboratory for his evidence processing just beneath the command center.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>4) An armory for spare suits and crime fighting equipment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>5) A holding cell on the bottom of the cave.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>6) A museum space for the essential batman mementos ( costumes, dinosaur, large&nbsp;coin, the joker card etc.&nbsp;).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Incorporated the following vehicles as well:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>1) A two-seater Batcopter with its own helipad.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) A Batmobile mounted on&nbsp;a manually elevated platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) A garage for the Batcycle and additional vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) A two-seater Batwing resting on its launcher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5) A Batboat with its own dock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again this is a base build, and can be customized according to the taste of the builder.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simplicity and Playability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is my 17th build, and hopefully more to come, if you like this model please do share and support this build through your friends and your social network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your opinions, suggestions and comments are most welcome.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank You and&nbsp;Happy Building :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My other

The&nbsp;base plates&nbsp;can easily be parted&nbsp;again and reshuffled to create a new park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have added a picture with Theme Park units&nbsp;put together, so you can see an example of a Theme Park.

Might be a short title, but hey what else is there to say. These are two&nbsp;1969 Ford Mustang Fastbacks that were suggested by MgX5montana. He told me and LegoBricker to build it, and we proudly built them as a joint project. This project has a lot of time and effort put into it. I used POV-ray rendering to get this project looking really nice, and Online Image Editor to put all writing, and the Vignette on the render. Starting with LegoBricker&#39;s sweet looking Fastback, he has went with a more city style build. He chose cherry red with black and light grey accents. He even did black out windows! Moving on to the second car. This one takes on more of the classic look with a beautiful dark green with black and light grey accents.&nbsp;Both have a fully&nbsp;detailed&nbsp;interior&nbsp;with a steering wheel, two black seats,&nbsp;speedometers, and a complete dash. Both have the classical mustang taillight. LegoBicker&#39;s has two taillights sets&nbsp;while mine sports the three taillights sets. The fronts also have differences. LegoBricker&#39;s features two headlights, while mine has the two extra headlights in the grille. LegoBricker has also incorporated a hood scoop. These two beautiful gems contain a grand total of 269 pieces and would probably sell for $30 US currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you all for supporting, and a huge thanks to LegoBricker for his work on this project!

This temple has only one room and the smallest size of oriental style buildings, Though It has many exterior decorations. I wonder how many pieces are used in only this one builidng. As a result, I realized that a oriental building&nbsp;uses too many pieces of lego block.&nbsp;&nbsp;This small building used&nbsp;more than 1,000 pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After I have built the building, also I made some background such as pine trees, cherryblossom trees, mushrooms, bamboos, flowers and a pagoda. And I located a monk figure&nbsp;who is worshiping&nbsp;front of the temple. I think lego has so few oriental garments. I barely find oriental look in Ninjago series. But it&#39;s only japanese style. Japanese style is not&nbsp;a single&nbsp;oriental style and not a single&nbsp;far eastern style too. I wish that LEGO release more variety garment styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Number of pieces:</strong> 2,043</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>LDD File Download:</strong> http://blog.naver.com/84jjukjang/220745767930</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": [], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-27T07:35:34.000Z", "user": {"alias": "jjukjang", "id": 870151, "uuid": "6ec02932-a0bb-4fac-8d07-7c7f63b61a24"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "37", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "116", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-27T07:35:34.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 27, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/96a/de6/145622/2525654-o_1am3q22n61hso33cp7d1l1p1gvs7-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 27, "stats_views_count_short": "481"}, {"stats_days_left": 333.561308273044, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:09.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/b8d/906/145520/2524516-o_1am1i1ph6da8b59thm160s1me2e-thumbnail-lcBct1jR8DV-HA.jpeg", "stats_supporters_count": 30, "published_at": "2016-06-27T07:26:20.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 16, "stats_comments_count_short": "15", "id": 145520, "user_id": 1100144, "uuid": "e8219152-6b7f-4f3d-a09c-0d3851fd19cb", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Little Red Speeder", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 186, "body": "<p>This Little Red Speeder, is meant&nbsp;for racing around the track, or on the highway!

My main motive for designing this model was just the fact that I didn&#39;t really like the official LEGO&nbsp;Jurassic World version. It&#39;s oversized, features un-needed flick-fire missiles and it just doesn&#39;t do justice to the beauty of the original vehicle. Despite all of this however, LEGO&#39;s version of the Jeep in their video game does do justice to it so that is what I based this model on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The model has enough room on the inside for one driver and a passenger or cargo to sit in the back allowing you to recreate the scene where Dr Sattler and Muldoon rescue Dr Malcom after the Tyrannosaur attack. If you were to put a passenger in the back it will not sit down properly because in my model there is a 2x2 plate with a stud in the middle, I put this there to make it easier to put a crate in the back but this problem can be easily fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem I have with this model is the spare tire. It cannot be used to replace the actual wheels on the Jeep but I tried it with one of those tires and it was way too big so this seemed like a reasonable compromise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoyed this model please share it with your friends and family.

This model also has an additional umbrella and chair that can fit in the boat while traveling. The RV is 8 wide and can sit two minifigures side by side. The RV has a small kitchen, a small sized wall slide out, a mini bedroom, and a couch. The boat has two seats and a control center.

I think this would be a great set because of the play value for kids of many ages. Not only does the RV have an inside, but it comes with a boat to add to the play. It also may encourage kids to want to go camping and enjoy the outdoors with their family.

They all hope the Wizard of Oz will help them, before the Wicked Witch of the West catches up with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Includes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Dorothy</li>\r\n\t<li>Munchkins</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Please support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like this project, please check out my other projects!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Wizard of oz", "dorothy", "movie", "movie scene", "classic"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-24T11:00:29.000Z", "user": {"alias": "bear7994", "id": 593307, "uuid": "8a2993c1-ec0d-4104-b393-9a985786c213"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "11", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "20", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-24T11:00:29.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 24, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/4a2/11b/145421/2522903-o_1alvd8igh11ss16p5dbb1fgkgih7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 15, "stats_views_count_short": "186"}, {"stats_days_left": 330.7086658330208, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:09.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/294/0e2/145364/2522045-o_1alul9guj9f0n3ns489ra1j277-thumbnail-3FgygEmPQY5xDA.png", "stats_supporters_count": 13, "published_at": "2016-06-24T10:58:32.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 9, "stats_comments_count_short": "8", "id": 145364, "user_id": 709936, "uuid": "88d84695-5c92-4fab-af8c-da695178dd50", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Victory", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 106, "body": "<p>Hello to all my project and the cup of Europe 2016, a trophy for the winner of these football matches.<br />\r\nFor all football fans and even for those not &#39;buff but he likes to watch the games of his nation, a cup for the winner of this special tournament that fascinates many people in the world.<br />\r\nAlthough it is not &#39;a world but there are many European teams and therefore many fans and football fans,&nbsp;and a nice simple design for all young people and adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;European Football Championship&nbsp;2016 (in French:&nbsp;Championnat&nbsp;d&#39;Europe&nbsp;de football&nbsp;2016),&nbsp;also known as&nbsp;Euro&nbsp;2016&nbsp;or&nbsp;France&nbsp;in 2016,&nbsp;is the&nbsp;15th edition&nbsp;of the football tournament&nbsp;for men&#39;s&nbsp;national teams&nbsp;organized by&nbsp;UEFA, whose&nbsp;finalswill be hosted&nbsp;France&nbsp;from June 10&nbsp;to July 10,&nbsp;2016.&nbsp;previously, the&nbsp;same countryhad hosted&nbsp;the editions&nbsp;of 1960&nbsp;and 1984.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main innovation&nbsp;in the format&nbsp;regards enlargement&nbsp;of the number ofparticipants&nbsp;from 16 to 24, taking&nbsp;the formula&nbsp;that characterized&nbsp;the world championships&nbsp;from 1986 to&nbsp;1994.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe victory&nbsp;of the tournament&nbsp;will guarantee&nbsp;the right to&nbsp;participation in the Confederations Cup&nbsp;2017.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;in case of&nbsp;victory of Germany&nbsp;(already qualified&nbsp;to represent&nbsp;FIFA&nbsp;as the winner&nbsp;of the&nbsp;last&nbsp;World)&nbsp;to participate&nbsp;will be the finalist in&nbsp;defeat.

This is my creation for a future oriented bike service. Electric bikes to move faster and in a cleaner way through our Lego city and a confortable service for all Lego citizen: Bike Sharing.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Electric bike sharing</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>The station is composed by various docks where Lego citizens can pick up or park the electric bikes. White docks are the point where you can pick up the bike. Bikes can be perfectly inserted inside docks. If you have a green light the bike battery charging is complete, so you have a full electric autonomy (30 kilometers more or less). If the light is red the dock is empty (no bike) or charging is not complete. It&#39;ll be a funny game to substitute green or red lights when a new bike is fully charged or simply attached to the dock. In any case electric bikes are easy to boost by your legs, like any other bike. But in this way electric power will help you, you&#39;ll move faster and you&#39;ll save part of your energy.&nbsp; How to use it? Bike sharing always move from one point to another (from A to B): imagine you have a big Lego city, you can buy one or more Bike sharing sets, mount the docks in any part of the city you prefer (the docks are modular) and so the user will pick up the electric bike in point A of the city and will park it in point B.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>A nice place</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>In our cities bike sharing docks are often along roads or in similar places. In this case I created a garden around the station, some LED street lamps to light the station during the night, and a fountain to recover fresh water during the hot season. Usually bike sharing&nbsp;provide all white, or all blue, or all red bikes:&nbsp;in my case all bikes are differently coloured.&nbsp;&nbsp;A nice place to stop, a nice place to start from!</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>The cycling road</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>The entire station has a cycling road inside, red coloured, that will reconnect to cycling lanes in our Lego city.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>There are many things inside this creation, I&#39;ll surely update this idea during next week focusing on some particulars.

Think of yourself being a traveler with a camera in one hand, brand new straw hat on your back, and having a brunch in MJC&#39;s.

A kitchen is filled with stoves, a big glossy cooking table, and lots of pans and dishes. Big glass panels are installed on the wall to enable customers to appreciate chef&rsquo;s skillful cooking. A hidden basement has been storing bottles of sweet ice wines from the town vineyard since last winter. If you have a bite of the testers at the food stand on the road and check out menu list, you cannot help coming inside to order your lunch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; Party room on the second floor is opened for any communities. Gather for social networking, birthday party and any special moments with your friends. Please contact right now to book the place! A wide comfortable sofa, a mini figure sized grand piano, sitting chairs, a food table, an antique wind cellar are available to use for free. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; The third floor is a lounge with an observatory. You cannot miss beautiful scenes of downtown through the telescope. A bending machine is ready to supply casual drinks for thirsty tourists. Part of this floor is the space for the owner of the building. The room is used as an office and living space for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; The rooftop is a young artist&rsquo;s studio. He sells his artworks to residents and tourists. All artworks hang on the walls in this building are his master pieces, which creates a friendly, good vibe. He is proud of a small gallery at the corner of the workshop to show up recent paintings. A TV, a small cupboard, a paint shelf, papers, and an old easel are precious treasures of this young artist. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; The artist, chef, clerk, owner, tourist, kitten and taxi driver are suggested mini figures to come together with this modular.

It is constructed with over 900 bricks, and is 23.6 studs x 33 1/6 studs x 9 1/6 bricks, and weighs only 1.46 lbs. The laptop&#39;s hinges are built just right, so that there&#39;s enough friction to keep the laptop closed or open, but not too much so that it&#39;s easy to open, revealing the features inside. The fully customizable screen has plenty of space to build whatever images you want, the printed and custom-colored keys are actually pressable (via the incredibly clever use of rubber bands), the mousepad has two buttons and a scroll bar, there are two speakers, and 7 extra buttons toward the top. On the outside, you can place the included brick-built thumbdrive in the snap-in USB ports, or place your headphone connection in either of the headphone jacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The model is full of tricky techniques and building styles that could put any builder to the test. The most difficult part is suspending 33 rubber bands between tiny stud plates, hidden between the keyboard and the 8x16 tiles.

This is a joint creation with LoneCoyote.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["truck", "canyon", "gmc", "caribou", "2016 gmc canyon"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-23T06:30:47.000Z", "user": {"alias": "StudTech", "id": 1046886, "uuid": "8f6ecf31-9c04-42db-9daf-fedeb4c3006d"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "18", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "23", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-23T06:30:47.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 23, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/0a1/03a/145320/2521451-o_1altcm3qiqbl1ggr139d1709171o7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 38, "stats_views_count_short": "202"}, {"stats_days_left": 329.52025907703705, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:04:35.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/1d3/afa/124996/2516714-o_1alp60u341umt10e3172p1b26ani7-thumbnail-7xfnk4LyCK2vBA.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 80, "published_at": "2016-06-23T06:27:14.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 24, "stats_comments_count_short": "40", "id": 124996, "user_id": 519203, "uuid": "1b177849-54ba-4d6b-bed9-c9cb584013cf", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Justice League - Hall of Justice", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 685, "body": "<p><span>The&nbsp;</span><strong>Hall of Justice</strong><span>&nbsp;is the headquarters</span><span>&nbsp;of the Super Friends</span><span>, in the eponymous animated </span><span>series.

Added a kitchen, a bathroom and a holding cell all located at the back end of the&nbsp;ground floor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second floor is where you will find the living quarters/dormitory as well as the storage vault and a museum,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sides of the building can be opened as shown in the pictures, while the cover flap can be used as base for additional items depending on the user.

The truck also features sport style rims. The rear is fairly basic, with a black bumper, and a set of taillights. The front is the same with a black bumper and a set of headlights.

The inverted take down is just like in the game, the guy is dangling over the ground, and with a shorter LEGO rope element if you take the stud of the thug will crash to the ground with severe brain damage.

SEGA&#39;s little blue bomber blazed across&nbsp;TV&nbsp;screens at lightning speed. He was full of &#39;90s attitude and was seen as hip and cool. Given Sonic&#39;s reputation for for being fast, his&nbsp;quick rise in popularity should come as no surprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sonic was everywhere. Hit sequels followed, as did comic books and television shows.&nbsp;McDonald&#39;s had Sonic-themed Happy Meal toys. He even made his way into the Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade as a giant character balloon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his debut 25 years ago, the speedy blue hedgehog&nbsp;has appeared in dozens of&nbsp;games across several different platforms. He even made his way into Nintendo games, which was unthinkable in the 1990s. More recently, he was announced as a confirmed character in&nbsp;<em>LEGO Dimensions</em>.&nbsp;In other words, Sonic has become one of the most timeless characters in the world of video games.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to&nbsp;Help Sonic Become a LEGO Set:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sonic you see in this project stands as a tribute to SEGA&#39;s little blue wonder. Because this is a buildable action figure, you can pose Sonic however you want to. He even comes with one of his iconic rings, which his individual fingers can latch on to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Achieving 10,000 supporters is no easy task, which is why Sonic needs your help! If you want to see this idea through, please consider sharing the project with&nbsp;your friends on Facebook and Twitter. Share Sonic with your favorite blogs, fan sites or forums. With your support, Sonic will be able to reach 10,000 supporters in no time!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thanks for supporting!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you like this, please consider supporting other projects I</em><em>&#39;m involved in, such as:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Steampunk Volkswagen Camper Van\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/136270\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/136270</a></li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Batman: Mini Battle for The Batcave&nbsp;(a collaboration between omarovalle, mreilly44 and myself)\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/120166\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/120166</a></li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Sonic the Hedgehog", "Sonic", "Hedgehog", "SEGA", "BrickadierG", "Video Game", "Video Games", "retro", "SEGA Genesis", "Mega Drive", "Action Figure", "Constraction", "Green Hill Zone", "History", "gaming", "character", "animal"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-22T07:11:41.000Z", "user": {"alias": "BrickadierG", "id": 275, "uuid": "6c5c2018-5ded-4bc6-8bb3-b1ba9788fc1e"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "40", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "155", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-22T07:11:41.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 22, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/d94/481/144762/2518605-o_1alqtimjpn05nud1b8c11dc1h187-full.JPG", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 30, "stats_views_count_short": "1k"}, {"stats_days_left": 328.5477787767014, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:09.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/dc1/f05/145201/2518808-o_1alqvs7j51h4uk2g1jppj141elg2s-thumbnail-V8UsqcrHjVuk4g.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 309, "published_at": "2016-06-22T07:06:52.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 76, "stats_comments_count_short": "44", "id": 145201, "user_id": 1032702, "uuid": "acac2c54-8514-4197-b249-eaeeee243e2a", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "The Fortune Casino", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 3005, "body": "<p>Dear friends!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am glad to present updated The Fortune casino project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&#39;s new:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- new design of windows on the second floor;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- new design of the blue building;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- third floor with rooftop bar and swimming pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like swimming and milkshakes, you must go there!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome to fabulous &quot;The Fortune&quot; casino!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See photos and support the project!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This construction set includes two separate buildings:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The building of &quot;The Fortune&quot; casino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- A small abandoned building of the slot-machines club &quot;777&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;777&rdquo; was a popular place for fans to play on the slot machines.

It&nbsp;is folding (maybe i&#39;m wrong with the term - but it actually opens and holds on 2 hinges) house and has 4 fully-equipped rooms:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- a tiny kitchen with a stove, a drawer for yummies, a shelf for his favorite cow&nbsp;milk (not some soy milk-like drink), a knife holder and of course the selfie-mount for taking pictures of his parties (though its a pity that sometimes those parties may be pretty lonesome)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- a living room is nothing without a&nbsp;foldable laptop mount (the Yeti always posts his new selfies on his social network&nbsp;account), a nice chair to seat in and some drawers and a clock</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- the dining room is a one-seater (poor lonely Yeti) and has plenty of space for him</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- a bedroom next to the oak club holder (feared&nbsp;weapon among forest creatures and lonely wanderers)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- and we shouldn&#39;t forget about the large barrel on top of the house - it is the Yeti&#39;s bath!! The rain water fills the barrel and then he can wash himself or just chill during a hot sunny day)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole design of the house is very minimalistic in order to fit on a 16x8 plate, but it has all needed for a long lonely life in the deepness of the forest. It consists of 120-140 parts but many of them are just round 1x1 round parts of flowers (wanted to add extra cosiness and detail to it).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Yeti nutrition is very different - he grows veggies at his garden, hunts, sneaks into the cowshed of farmers and milks his milk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warning&nbsp;- if you see the club holding in the second floor passage that means the Yeti does not want to see any visitors!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please enjoy - i hope you guys like it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["selfie-stick", "yeti", "forest", "house"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-22T06:51:36.000Z", "user": {"alias": "sionitsky", "id": 1082577, "uuid": "c8f77974-7ed7-4187-b496-a1689dcbd9c0"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "19", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "33", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-22T06:51:36.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 22, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/dab/1ad/145035/2517733-o_1alq4kl15h4p1sd318i41v17qp37-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 8, "stats_views_count_short": "285"}, {"stats_days_left": 328.5366552915394, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:07.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/d84/c03/145047/2516322-o_1alnsb192f464p81pk1ln91bht7-thumbnail-JdA07ceyEWZvLw.png", "stats_supporters_count": 12, "published_at": "2016-06-22T06:50:51.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 11, "stats_comments_count_short": "13", "id": 145047, "user_id": 460084, "uuid": "de468fb4-fcb6-49f7-b031-6acdae38ceb6", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Icon A5", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 120, "body": "<p>The Icon A5 is a seaplane that can run on aviation fuel and unleaded gasoline.

The great artist and engineer Leonardo Da Vinci is often credited as the first to propose a reasonable flying machine in 1490: a giant bat-shaped craft that uses both the pilot&rsquo;s arms and legs to power the wings. Though the aircraft was never built, and we now know that it would not have flown, it was a remarkable achievement considering the knowledge of the day. At the turn of the 20th century, focus shifted both in the method of thrust production, from flapping wings to the propeller, and the method of power generation, from the human body to the internal combustion engine. With the aerodynamic problem greatly simplified, the impossibility of human flight was disproved by the Wright brother&rsquo;s flight in 1903 and the stage was set for the boom of aircraft developments in the decades to come.

This is the 2017 Ram Ramcharger concept. This was originally produced from&nbsp;1874 to1984, and now Ram is thinking about re-producing it! This truck is based on the format of the Ram Powerwagon, except in a two door form on a SUV chassis.&nbsp;This concept was&nbsp;not introduced at a car show, rather the 2016 Moab. At Moab this year, all the Jeeps were out roaming the area when they sneaked the Ramcharger in. This one is based identically to the real one. It is two door SUV form. Under the hood, there is a powerful 5.4 liter Hemi V8! The interior is rather simple. With only two light grey seats, and a complete dash board. The front end strongly resembles the Ram styling. This set contains 133 bricks and would sell between $13 and $20 US currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you all for clicking the Support button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["truck", "SUV", "ram", "dodge", "ramcharger", "black", "moab", "off-roader"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-22T06:32:16.000Z", "user": {"alias": "LoneCoyote", "id": 966783, "uuid": "ef2d01aa-41f1-452d-ae68-daf7296a0b60"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "14", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "22", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-22T06:32:16.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 22, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/63e/59f/145034/2515975-o_1alngq1m61ik610l4jl87m10n37-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 37, "stats_views_count_short": "140"}, {"stats_days_left": 328.52354074177083, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:07.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/900/b3f/145019/2515744-o_1alna0ekg1kcd2lt1doaqp9b4he-thumbnail-s7o0R07N9uFIUQ.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 12, "published_at": "2016-06-22T06:31:58.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 11, "stats_comments_count_short": "8", "id": 145019, "user_id": 1092867, "uuid": "a5b97f27-649c-4738-a1c2-e3ba3e89c7ea", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Vintage Redefined", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 115, "body": "<p>I have always been fascinated with vintage cars.

But the classic looks of the oldies still rein the heart of the real car lovers.

Many goods depots operated throughout the night which required an appropriate level of lighting across the working areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model is fitted with the Lego Technic Power Functions lighting system consisting of Battery Pack M8881, several LED M8870 and Extension Cable M8871 packs. The depot has external lighting in the form of simulated floodlighting on both the railway platform side and lorry loading bay side, and internal lighting to simulate the general illumination associated with ceiling lights. The roof of the depot has transparent sky lights which also emit light in the dark in a similar manner to the real thing. Several pictures have been taken in a low background light condition to show the effectiveness of the depot lighting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the model shown here includes several examples of the Scammell Scarab delivery vehicle, any of the existing Lego City delivery vehicles will work just as well. Similarly, the workmen figures could easily be replaced with a Lego Mini Figure set if required. Also shown is a drop side railway goods wagon which may be integrated with any of the existing Lego railway goods wagons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic goods depot includes the loading/unloading bay, an office building with opening doors and outside lighting and an additional store house to disguise the M8881 battery box (the battery box switch is accessed through the blue doors, and battery box removal is via a rear door). Although disguising the battery box as a store house does make the model look a bit more realistic, it may be omitted to simplify things and keep the cost down. Also included are two short lengths of railway track and two buffer stops with illuminated red stop lamps (M8870).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The appeal</strong><br />\r\nThe overall aim of this set is to produce a model of a typical railway goods depot that may be produced as one large set including road and rail vehicles, and with a full lighting kit as shown here, or as several smaller sets building up into the full set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model set is intended to be sufficiently accurate to appeal to the older collector and young builder. The inclusion of electric lighting enhances the overall appeal of the model to the older collector and younger builder, and also introduces a heightened play experience for the young builder.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["lego city", "town", "train", "railway", "technic", "goods", "wagon", "power functions", "delivery", "delivery truck", "minifigure", "battery", "lights"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-21T06:31:43.000Z", "user": {"alias": "retrodes", "id": 1018879, "uuid": "fb4b95cf-0961-4c59-adc9-c4fe2c8cbbdb"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "23", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "48", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-21T06:31:43.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 21, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/636/1cf/145011/2515479-o_1almv5q9lfrl1pq4drg19b41h48e-full.JPG", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 39, "stats_views_count_short": "436"}, {"stats_days_left": 327.5229818131597, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:07.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/e15/124/144921/2513824-o_1aljvj1kl12j44h1hj41uhfn8s7-thumbnail-GPJ00VWkiTSH0A.png", "stats_supporters_count": 49, "published_at": "2016-06-21T06:31:10.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 20, "stats_comments_count_short": "33", "id": 144921, "user_id": 997819, "uuid": "01a4d0a0-052e-4d30-9eb0-2c52e42c38aa", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Club Car", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 336, "body": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This club car is a perfect extension of the prevalent city passenger train.

The fleet was rediscovered 6 years before the Battle of Yavin by Talon Karrde and Captain Hoffner.

The Dreadnaught itself has 6 Turbolaser blisters and 4 Quad Laser Blisters, a communications array, and a removable roof and nose to access the Turbolaser Capacitors and Bridge.

Lets ask Chris Woodford and Explainthatstaff. com :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In fact, the only energy involved in making a jackhammer pound up and down is supplied from an air hose. The hose, which has to be made of especially thick plastic, carries high-pressure air (typically 10 times higher pressure than the air around us) from a separate air-compressor unit powered by a diesel engine. The air compressor is a bit like a giant bicycle pump that never stops blowing air. When the worker presses down on the handle, air pumps from the compressor into the jackhammer through a valve on one side. Inside the hammer, there&#39;s a circuit of air tubes, a heavy piledriver, and a drill bit at the bottom. First, the high-pressure air flows one way round the circuit, forcing the piledriver down so it pounds into the drill bit, smashing it into the ground. A valve inside the tube network then flips over, causing the air to circulate in the opposite direction. Now the piledriver moves back upward, so the drill bit relaxes from the ground. A short time later, the valve flips over again and the whole process repeats&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Must have for any Lego City road repairing team!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.S.

It is 17&#39;1/2 inches X 4 inches X 5 inches. This model took me 3 months to develop and its about 800-950 pieces. I took inspiration from the &quot;Lego Birds&quot; Ideas model set and wanted to make something related to an animal. So instead of a land animal I chose an underwater animal and that&#39;s where the Great White Shark came to mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to add as much texture as i could to &quot;bring the model to life&quot; I added many slope pieces to create the body of the model. I also added Tiles in random spots to give the model a more rugged look. The black tiles near his snout represent gills for breathing underwater as well as a way to cover the insides of the model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fins of the model all are able to move except for the top fin because I wanted to put as much character into that fin as I could. For that fin I added More slope pieces as well as some studs for character and grill tiles to give it a tougher look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried my best to mix&nbsp;dark grey pieces and white pieces together because an actual great White Shark usuallyhas a darker top &nbsp;and a whiter bottom for his body. So, I blended the two colors together but also sometimes making the dark gray pieces go lower or the white pieces higher to give the shark a unique look and show that every shark is different in the way they look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I created a basic stand to hold the shark in place. It was mostly made of Technic pieces but also Lego Plates to hold the stand together. It was designed to have 6&nbsp;claws to grip the model in place&nbsp;and the two claws in the front of the stand have a Technic beam holding then together so the mouth of the model will be held in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside of the model&#39;s mouth, I created a imitation of the inside of the shark by using red plates and jumper pieces to look like the inside of the shark. For its head and eyes, I use two transparent yellow jumper plates to imitate eyes and used many different ways to create and develop the head of the shark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall thank you for reading and looking at my model and imitation or the Great White Shark. Lets hit 10,000 supporters&nbsp;to show off this massive beast and the king of the sea...</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Lego", "marine life", "great white shark", "shark", "underwater", "fish", "collector", "collectible", "animals", "underwater set", "toy", "model"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-20T07:03:41.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Birdboy512", "id": 1054730, "uuid": "c479f87b-6333-4fc8-801d-672e5d678092"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "22", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "56", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-20T07:03:41.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 20, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/45b/aca/144875/2512959-o_1ali6jh4bh97a0f18rnuub1t847-full.JPG", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 16, "stats_views_count_short": "330"}, {"stats_days_left": 326.5448185643287, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:06.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/189/255/143988/2513118-o_1alico3tsvi1ied91758l1g3d7-thumbnail-uBBmhvg8tcBvZA.png", "stats_supporters_count": 36, "published_at": "2016-06-20T07:02:37.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 19, "stats_comments_count_short": "14", "id": 143988, "user_id": 155837, "uuid": "ca5788aa-61c9-4be8-8f2c-3eb4884d5ae2", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "The Legend of Zelda - Forest Temple", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 256, "body": "<p>The entrance to the Forest Temple</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>he Forest Temple is a large labyrinth with many complex puzzles and&nbsp;</span>Small Keys<span>&nbsp;found in abstruse places.

I will begin by listing each Figure and a small summary. Thank you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>1. The main hero of team sonic, which of course is Sonic T. Hedgehog himself. He&#39;s blue and fast, but most importantly, he&#39;s cool! In the LEGO Dimension&#39;s new E3 trailer it reveals that Sega&#39;s Sonic theme will now be in LEGO form. Which is amazing and super exciting, and it at the same time&nbsp;gave me the idea of LEGO Meh Burger.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>2. He&#39;s a hedgehog as well. He&#39;s also fast and cool, but he definitely isn&#39;t blue. You guessed it, Shadow the Hedgehog. His fur is the same color as his name and in his hair there are stripes of red. He is included along side his counterpart Sonic, for the reason that he was battling Sonic, where the episode takes place. And their fight was somewhere near Meh Burger, which is why I featured it as the main build of this project!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>3. The bald, evil, and sinister scientist, Dr Eggman is also included in this set. He was in the scene of the fight and he dazed Shadow with a camera. (Which is why Shadow actually lost)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>4. The most important person in the food industry (because Meh Burger is the only shop in that town:P ) as well as an official member of the Lightning Bolt Society, and a former fan of Eggman. Its, Dave the Intern. In this project he&#39;s wearing a hot dog suit, because that mostly fit him and he is just waiting there in the front of his shop for someone&nbsp;to buy a burger and chili dog!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>W</em>ow! That wasn&#39;t as easy then I thought it would be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I guess, I&#39;ll review the build itself. Here goes something :P.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all starts with one green base plate and then it builds up to 245 pieces! I included a tree on the left side of Meh Burger and three boxes on the right that say on it &quot;Old dogs&quot; and yes it has old dogs in it. :P Then for the main build itself, I tried to make as accurate as possible, and hopefully in your point of view, I did. I even used the Meh Burger Logo for&nbsp;the top of the shop. Thank you for spending your time reading this (if you even did) and please please please, support. I for one really want to play and add this set to my collection. Thank you!

Yet another project. Recently I played Undertale, which is an RPG created by Toby Fox and created with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/GameMaker:_Studio\">GameMaker: Studio</a>. You play the role oh a fallen human. Depending on which path you take in the game, you can be Frisk or Chara (as far as I know(I&#39;m probably wrong)). The first character you meet in the game is a flower named Flowey.&nbsp;<em>Howdy. I&#39;m Flowey. Flowey the Flower!&nbsp;</em>He teaches you that you must increase your LV(Love) by gaining experience. He claims that love is transfered through tiny white pellets. When you attempt to get some, he says:&nbsp;<em>In this world... It&#39;s KILL or BE killed!</em>&nbsp;Which is pretty true. If you dodge his &quot;friendliness pellets&quot; he will become annoyed and say:&nbsp;<em>GO! INTO! THE BULLETS!!</em>&nbsp;Then he will do what he normally does and in large text says: <strong>DIE.&nbsp;</strong>Then you are saved by Toriel, but you can read the wiki page or play the game if you&#39;re interested in that. Click <a href=\"http://undertale.wikia.com/wiki/Flowey\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to go to Flowey&#39;s wiki page. This is a Mosaic of him. In case you are wondering this was built in LeoCAD and I highly recommend you use that. Then I rendered it in Blender. This set includes a 48x48 mosaic of Flowey. It includes the name on the left.

It&#39;s a really awesome vehicle and has great potential in expanding what could be Tron Lego sets. One of the biggest questions for me was, what would the bad guys be driving? yet another light cycle? no, that would be a bit repetitive. so i thought i&#39;d explore something else in the movie. Those cool parachute glider things! (not to&nbsp;be confused with the light jets) I know it&#39;s not exactly the sequence of events from the movie, but i thought it was cool so i ran with it, cause it wouldn&#39;t be likely to show up elsewhere in another set so why not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyways, I also decided to go with Flynn and Quorra without helmets to give variety to my tron sets, as well as because they kind of take them off as they drive away. Though they could also be included so yeah. &nbsp;A future improvement&nbsp;i would like to include would be some sort of firing mechanism for the light runner. Many of the renders I did in gray and white colors because the Black is so hard to see sometimes, I wanted you to be able to see the build and how it&#39;s built. The build currently sits at a totally of 268 pieces.&nbsp;<span>Anyways, I hope you all like it and will help me by supporting and spreading this around via social media and whatnot.

It is&nbsp;fun to build different rides with just a&nbsp;small&nbsp;amount of bricks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the sets are constructed on 16x16 base plates which you can snap&nbsp;together to create a large Theme Park. The&nbsp;base plates&nbsp;can easily be parted&nbsp;again and reshuffled to create a new park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have added a picture with Theme Park units&nbsp;put together, so you can see an example of a Theme Park. All parts have now been posted here so please feel free to support them all!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My earlier parts are found here:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Octopus ride: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/139452\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/139452</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Merry-Go-Around: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/139940\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/139940</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Observation Tower (<strong>updated</strong>): <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/140355\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/140355</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rollercoaster: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/140699\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/140699</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Viking ship ride: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/141286\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/141286</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dino Explorer Ride: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/141720\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/141720</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Flying Carpet Ride: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/142020\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/142020</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bumper Cars: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/142368\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/142368</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>River Splash Ride: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/142578\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/142578</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Free Fall Ride: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/143073\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/143073</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haunted House: <a href=\"https://ideas.lego.com/projects/143270\" target=\"_blank\">https://ideas.lego.com/projects/143270</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samba Balloon Ride: https://ideas.lego.com/projects/143847</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["miniature", "miniature lego", "micro", "microscale", "micro scale", "microfigure", "microfig", "fun", "park", "theme park", "themepark", "ride", "rides", "landscape", "modular", "modular building", "modular buildings", "castle", "modular series", "modulars"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-17T06:37:11.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Futurama", "id": 1059449, "uuid": "40f6360b-37a9-4464-a67a-bf188e378526"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "18", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "38", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-17T06:37:11.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 17, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/389/791/144725/2510100-o_1ald5jbrtdrdikq1q2h1qs91ap7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 41, "stats_views_count_short": "287"}, {"stats_days_left": 323.52699956662036, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:07.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/4b7/d54/144717/2509811-o_1al9rh7ee70112fb176075vpva7-thumbnail-Unp9BoYbv1cnlw.png", "stats_supporters_count": 79, "published_at": "2016-06-17T06:36:58.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 25, "stats_comments_count_short": "26", "id": 144717, "user_id": 1078558, "uuid": "b21ddf82-89b0-4d35-85f6-b6ca7f358da6", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Lego Laptop", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 669, "body": "<p><strong>Lego Laptop</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nHello!

It weighs in at a hefty 3.04 &nbsp;kilograms and you will see in the images how it measures up &nbsp;against the L350F Lego Technic loader. The purpose of this the vessel, is to explore th&nbsp;depths of the Earths oceans by&nbsp;bringing back intriguing information from their&nbsp;unmanned&nbsp;submarine. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;You will find 13 rooms on the ship these include: four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen/Dining, a utility room ,a&nbsp;bridge, a computer room, an&nbsp;engine room, a workroom&nbsp;and finally a seating area. &nbsp; Within these rooms,&nbsp;you will find many different types of accessories and furniture like beds, &nbsp;toothbrushes, chicken legs, microscopes, computers and so on. I &nbsp;can also proudly say that every feature works with the mini figures take the bunkbeds &nbsp;for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the bow of the ship there is a fully functional anchor, Lego tyre fenders, an&nbsp;openable hatch and a life ring. At the stern of the ship the are 2&nbsp;cranes (1&nbsp;of which can be entered), an openable hatch&nbsp;for the submarine and some life jacket storage. Lining the ship&#39;s hull&nbsp;are Lego tire fenders held up by chains.On&nbsp;top of the boat there are many different electrical pieces of equipment with a flag. Next to the electrical equipment, you will find a yellow dinghy&nbsp;&nbsp;with a fully articulated custom out board motor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The set includes 4&nbsp;vehicles, one of which being the main boat. The other three attach to the boat in different ways: the dinghy &nbsp;attaches to the boat on the roof above the kitchen, the lifeboat is secured to the&nbsp;back of the boat by three technic pins and finally the submarine is held in place by 2 slanted colomns inside the workroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The lifeboat has eight seats inside of it to accommodate all crew members. &nbsp;As well as this the lifeboat comes equipped with a shelf for emergency rations. The lifejackets for the crew are stored inside the bow of the ship in two&nbsp;3 x 2 cupboards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That concludes my description of my Lego creation, I hope you enjoy looking through the images.

I love space so I express it in form of Lego model. At first, I got confused when trying to build the satelite using the black long brick as you can see at some of the pictures I&#39;ve provided. Then finally I got the idea for the shape of the model then I started to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This satelite has two rooms, The main room is the control room, where the spaceman works. This room is facilitated with 3 computers, 2 cupboards, and some tool holders. The second room is actually not facilitated. The second room, which takes place at the bottom of the satelite, was facilitated with a lever to fix the position of the radar while the satelite is on the horizontal mode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This satelite has 2 modes, horizontal mode and vertical mode. You just need to move the bottom part downwards to have a vertical mode and lift it upwards to have a horizontal mode. Whether the satelite is on the horizontal mode or vertical mode, the spaceman can&#39;t work without a hydraulic. This machine was attached to the spaceman. If its not in use, you can fold it down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The color scheme that I use in this model is Black, White, Blue, Red, Yellow, and Grey. But I need your opinion for the color scheme. Comment bellow to tell me what color for which part that I should fix. I&#39;ll very appreciate your help. There are some details that I can&#39;t tell you here, so I provide pictures for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks...</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Satelite", "space", "classic space figs", "spaceman", "machine", "antenna", "radar", "hydraulic", "classic", "classic space", "rope", "noozle", "computer", "tools", "cupboard", "control room", "hinge", "technology", "space theme", "minifigure"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-17T06:33:54.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Moses 1420", "id": 592957, "uuid": "040d1b36-2249-4f93-b6b9-075e8d8b9b81"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "10", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "16", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-17T06:33:54.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 17, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/d45/b28/144023/2498158-o_1akt9nel51k0kgeh1dik1ecarvhg-full.JPG", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 8, "stats_views_count_short": "119"}, {"stats_days_left": 323.52453295663196, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:07.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/c44/ca1/144697/2508951-o_1alclcjsuv50lkme2te1h9kkc-thumbnail-GFiB1xRBAKQGLA.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 181, "published_at": "2016-06-17T06:33:25.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 45, "stats_comments_count_short": "30", "id": 144697, "user_id": 961728, "uuid": "37ea6a71-7a5a-4bb5-aab2-ac98745206c9", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Extreme Evolution: Arctic Triceratops", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 1052, "body": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Features:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <strong>Play features</strong>.

We knew what LEGO could have added to the series, but they never did. Hopefully, this project and future projects I release will show the LEGO team what Lord of the Rings should have been. Please share and support this project if you love Lord of the Rings and Middle Earth as much as I do and want to see LEGO Lord of the Rings back on shelves!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Middle-Earth Minis</em> is a series which contains many small, microscale versions of the iconic places in Middle Earth. Since LEGO chose not to produce&nbsp;many locations, hopefully these can cover for some of them. In future updates, I will hopefully be able to create exclusive minifigures that LEGO did not provide us with. Ideally, all of the locations would come in one set with a Middle Earth Map and you could put each microscale version on their according locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the locations that are included in Series One.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bag End&nbsp;</strong>was a luxurious tunnel&nbsp;on the north-side of&nbsp;Hobbiton&nbsp;built in to the top of The Hill by &nbsp;Bungo Baggins as a wedding gift to his bride&nbsp;Belladonna Took. Only rooms on the west had windows, which opened out like portholes onto a grassy slope and distant meadows beyond. Bilbo lived in this house and Frodo grew up in it. The location is a key starter to both of their adventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Isengard (Orthanc)&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Orthanc</strong>&nbsp;is the black tower of Isengard. Orthanc was&nbsp;built during the end of the&nbsp;Second Age&nbsp;by men of&nbsp;Gondor. No known weapon could harm it. &nbsp;Orthanc rose up to more than 500 feet&nbsp;above the plain of Isengard, and ended in four sharp peaks. Its only entrance was at the top of a high stair. Orthanc housed one of the&nbsp;<em>palant&iacute;ri</em>&nbsp;of the South Kingdom, and was guarded by a special warden. When&nbsp;Beren,&nbsp;Steward of Gondor, gave Isengard to the&nbsp;Wizard&nbsp;Saruman, he also gave him the keys of Orthanc. Saruman made it his base of operations during his search for the&nbsp;One Ring&nbsp;and later his attack on Rohan during the&nbsp;War of the Ring. The lush green that surrounded the tower was turned into wasteland and industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Argonath-&nbsp;</strong>A monument comprising two enormous pillars carved in the likenesses of&nbsp;Isildur&nbsp;and&nbsp;An&aacute;rion, standing upon either side of the River&nbsp;Anduin. The figures were originally constructed&nbsp;at the order of King&nbsp;R&oacute;mendacil II&nbsp;to mark the northern border of&nbsp;Gondor. The Fellowship passed through this landmark on their way down the River Anduin from Lorien.&nbsp;Also known as the&nbsp;<strong>Gate of Kings</strong>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<strong>Pillars of the Kings</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Edoras</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The capital of Rohan is the hill fort of Edoras which is located on a hill in a valley of the&nbsp;</span>White Mountains<span>. the Golden Hall of the King of Rohan, is located there. </span><span>The city of Edoras was built by&nbsp;</span>Rohan&#39;s second King<span>,&nbsp;</span>Brego<span>&nbsp;son of&nbsp;</span>Eorl the Young<span>. </span><span>The city is protected only by a high wall of timber, and a one-way road allows access to the city. Just before the gates, two rows of&nbsp;</span>mounds<span>&nbsp;line the road, which are the graves of the former Kings of Rohan. The Golden Hall</span><span>&nbsp;serves as a house for the King and his kin, a meeting hall for the King and his advisors, and a gathering hall.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>Helms Deep</strong></span>&nbsp;was a large valley in the north-western Ered Nimrais (White Mountains). Helms Deep was used a refuge many times by the people of Rohan. It was never breached until Saruman ordered a force of 10,000 uruk-hai to attack it. This is where Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli defended with the soldiers of Rohan against Saruman&#39;s forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>Minas Tirith&nbsp;</strong></span>became the heavily fortified capital of Gondor in the second half of the Third Age. It was originally built to guard the former capital, Osgiliath, from attack from the west, but became the capital when Osgiliath fell into ruin. The city was made out of white stone and is considered the most beautiful fortresses ever to be built by men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are all of the locations I have so far, and I have more coming along. Please support and spread the word.

They helped the other minifigures to find a way back to their time, because they actually did not know how to use the future technology. This causes a wild trip through the whole universe, in which all those minifigures and some other living lego things became friends. Okay there was one enemy, but with the help of all their friends he got defeated and at the end everyone was back in the right time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model combines plants and a vehicle, which in our story was able to drive over land, but also dive in the oceans. Future Lego minifigures found out, how to combine technical innovation and natural evolution.

I hope this creation will become a LEGO set till the next jubilee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>My favorites</em></strong>&nbsp; Lego pirates is my favorite series, that&rsquo;s why I created my own version of a ship with 3 masts and 10 guns. I understand it&rsquo;s a beginning, a concept which can evolve thanks to your advice and become a set on shelves. My ship needs to be longer. If LEGO designers &nbsp;add hull sections to make a ship longer it would give more spacing between masts which will really give it a better look. LEGO always gives twice as less guns as gun ports. I improved that as many fans like it. My ship is based on a combination of Skull&rsquo;s Eye Schooner 6285 (1993) and Emperor&rsquo;s Ship 7416 (2003). All my gun ports are classic pirate flags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The main idea</em></strong>&nbsp; The Pirates series once included lots of ships but none had 3 masts. I used mostly big LEGO bricks to make it medium difficult to build. Besides people of all ages love pirate ships, children, men and women alike, all over the world. It can cost less than $200. The deck is removable and there is a large cannon deck. The set includes only 2 mini figures &ndash; the captain (series 14) and a classic pirate monkey in a crow&rsquo;s nest because I&rsquo;d like to know what mini figures my fans would like in his crew. I gave white epaulets to the captain because they were the most rare before 2014 and historically meant the highest rank, golden for officers and red or blue for privates. Comments, criticism and suggestions are welcome.&nbsp; But for it to appear on the horizon in the endless sea of LEGO sets it needs 10000 supporters. Please feel free to comment for me to know which aspects you&rsquo;d like to see in the updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;There are additional weapons. I think many LEGO fans don&rsquo;t like it that some sets often have fewer weapons than mini figures. There is a crane for treasure chests on a mast. It rotates and can move up and down.&nbsp;These things increase playability and help your fantasy to create plenty of stories.&nbsp;Designing sails LEGO teams often use Lego skulls and bones. I like that idea very much. But in my project the sails are red and skulls black as in Queen Ann&rsquo;s Revenge (4195). The deck and captain&rsquo;s cabin are removable and you can easily look inside and hide treasure there. All the masts have shrouds to get to crows&rsquo; nests. I always try to be attentive to such details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Interesting details</em></strong>: I used Ursula a Disney mini figure 2016 as a bow figure. And the black dragon wing is used as a wheel. The bowsprit with a triangle sail moves to the right and left. It was easy to do and added realism. I think the more realistic a toy is the more educational it can be for a child. Jack pumpkin head is its lantern. The black Knights halberd is its decoration. You can easily look inside the captain&rsquo;s cabin from the stern. The captain&rsquo;s cabin has doors to the deck and to the stern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;I tried to represent a quarter of a century of LEGO ships in one single project. I hope LEGO fans and your team will like it to become a LEGO ideas project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I know LEGO group issues pirates sailing boats every 5 years. So if my project becomes your official set to celebrate 30 years of LEGO pirates it would be great to include a nostalgic booklet with pictures of all pirate ships ever issued. It would make the set more collectible. I had that idea after seeing 5003082 a promotional pirates set. According to the House Rules I suggest what LEFO had done before. The booklet can be a part of your building instructions.&nbsp; I hope you like the idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;With best regards, Staslegomaster</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;I think this set would definitely fit into the LEGO pirates collection. So keep supporting this project and we&#39;ll be able to make it into an official LEGO set.&nbsp; And pirates admiral will sail to your collection on his 3 masts ship.But don&#39;t forget to share<strong> </strong>Grey Skull Frigate<strong> </strong>with your friends too via Facebook, Google+ and Twitter!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["frigate", "pirates", "skull"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-15T06:26:58.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Staslegomaster", "id": 743532, "uuid": "73bbb914-f7e5-41bc-8558-4c92a477f690"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "25", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "94", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-15T06:26:58.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 15, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/318/554/144478/2504963-o_1al7cla91i731ojbh03cralm8m-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 42, "stats_views_count_short": "829"}, {"stats_days_left": 321.5177195684375, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:07.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/f12/ce3/144394/2503438-o_1al58daff8gv46ikr4tdt1ke77-thumbnail-vUCQBfiD3iLAWw.png", "stats_supporters_count": 21, "published_at": "2016-06-15T06:23:37.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 15, "stats_comments_count_short": "43", "id": 144394, "user_id": 993033, "uuid": "39b70483-6202-4e18-b2d7-75458d025348", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Police Car", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 228, "body": "<p>If you need to catch a burglar, chase a criminal or just patrol around town, there is only one car you can use: the Camshaft Police Car!

Every player is evenly split apart, except the Goalie bar, on which each player is a bit closer together.

For me, one of the most interesting things about the Star Wars universe has always been the amazing designs of the creatures, the armours and the vehicles that makes it come to life,&nbsp;who make up the&nbsp;lived in, low-tech, tattered and damaged look of the world I came to love as&nbsp;a kid all those years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the new movie came out last Christmas I felt like a kid once more, for the first time in a long while. I was falling in love with Star Wars all over again, pouring over all the amazing designs of ships and aliens, new but still so familiar. The most eye-catching thing of them all, I felt, was Rey&acute;s popsicle-like speeder; the shape of it, the colour, the worn down state that makes it look fantastic and realistic at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&nbsp;knew I had to build it. I wanted to recreate it, get to know it, but I didn&acute;t know how. I didn&acute;t know if it could be constructed with LEGO in a way that would do it justice, but I had to find out. And though it took a long time to get it the way I wanted it, and though it&nbsp;left me scratching my head more than once,&nbsp;I just loved building it. And I think you would love building it too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since I first posted images of the model online, people have asked me if I have instructions for it and&nbsp;if they can buy it. Sadly,&nbsp;I don&acute;t have any instructions and I don&acute;t want to part from it. I like it too much on my shelf. And then came the suggestion that I should make it a project on LEGO ideas...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here it is;&nbsp;an&nbsp;advanced, UCS size model of Rey&acute;s already iconic speeder from Star Wars- The Force Awakens. It measures approximately 45cm in length and the scale makes it possible to capture all the exciting curves and interesting details of this rusty, beat-up beauty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI hope you like it, and if you want to build one of your own, support it and make it happen!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More photos can be found here:&nbsp;https://www.flickr.com/photos/133266472@N05/</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["star wars", "the force awakens", "ucs", "rey", "speeder", "rey's speeder"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-24T06:40:00.000Z", "user": {"alias": "Robert Lundmark", "id": 704278, "uuid": "3e8c635e-a4ce-46ea-aee7-e3ade77b7a87"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "804", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "4k", "support_ending_at": "2017-12-13T06:41:35.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 14, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/db6/b42/144406/2503658-o_1al5dib951r847bo6uk2810l7-full.jpg", "state_id": 150, "stats_comments_count": 435, "stats_views_count_short": "39k"}, {"stats_days_left": 320.5285272754398, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:07.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/8a5/591/144418/2503803-o_1al5ho3o81nba1qvj1bau1ak71hpc7-thumbnail-FxJiaIw0uMIBQA.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 23, "published_at": "2016-06-14T06:39:11.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 12, "stats_comments_count_short": "30", "id": 144418, "user_id": 593307, "uuid": "a556efac-9063-4f9e-beca-e7c09d066e71", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "I Dream of Jeannie", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 306, "body": "<p><span>Air Force captain Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Nelson is stranded on a desert island after his space capsule malfunctions on re-entry.

This started off with a thin bar and supports, that soon developed into a castle frontage, then came the portcullis and so on.&nbsp; Since then it is only lego model he owns that has not been &quot;re-distributed&quot; for other models.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>What&#39;s in it?</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nEssentially I have made a training area complete with an Archery range (bow and arrows), a spinning training dummy, a straw/wooden training dummy, a weapons rack with a full compliment of varied weapons, a Meeting pit with fire a spit roast, a food stand, a Bar, a shield stand, Balistraria(Arrowslit), access ladders, Secret entrance/exit, working portcullis &amp; a Ballista (Large Crossbow).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn total there are around 620 pieces however this is based upon what I have in our not too expansive lego collection, I&#39;m sure it could be easily reduced depending on the types of pieces available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI pictured it with 5 characters, (3 good for the tower and 2 bad guys to attack), not specifically Nexo ones, but my son insisted I use them in the photos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Photo editing.</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have included a bunch of Nexo shields simply to show where the original concept came from, I don&#39;t picture as being part of a final product, I have edited out the QR information to avoid any difficulties with protecting the product purchasing infringements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have also photo shopped some of the images to show colour matches to suit the intended brick colour which is why to the trained eye some images may look a little odd.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>That&#39;s it!</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nI look forward to seeing peoples comments and suggestions, If I reach the benchmarks I&#39;ll update with Building Instructions.&nbsp;

Thank you for taking the time to check out this project!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project depicts a restaurant in a park that serves one thing and one thing only: pizza. Next to the pizza restaurant is a small covered area where a band is performing. Nearby is a fruit tree to provide some greenery to the scene. There are sixteen minifigures included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Band</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under a small covered area, a four-person band is performing for their three loyal fans, who are raising their hands in the air in happiness. The drumset is based off of a real one, and is therefore as accurate as I could make it. A female pianist and a male guitarist also accompany the singer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Pizza Restaurant</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next to the area where the band is performing, a pizza restaurant attracts many customers. Outside, there is a trash can to prevent littering. Other than the one on the door, there are three windows in the restaurant. One is next to the door, another is above the sink in the kitchen, and a third is on the side of the building and is nearby the ordering area, in between the dining area and the kitchen. A sign reading &quot;Pizza&quot; created out of some red plates, red studs, and a curved track piece sits on top of the simple tan roof. Inside, blue tables, a blue floor, and white benches and chairs provide a comfortable space for diners to enjoy their freshly made pizzas. One table seats two, and the other seats four, where four diners are currently enjoying a pizza. At the ordering counter, an employee hands over a pizza to a man. All pizzas are put onto red plates. The kitchen is mostly white to complement the blue floor. However, a red oven and red sink provide a pop of color. The chef is currently preparing another pizza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, thank you for taking the time to check out this project!</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["pizza", "pizzeria",

My inspiration came from a few incredible catamarans I&nbsp;saw on the internet so I&nbsp;decided to build one myself&nbsp;out of Lego. I have tried many times before but this one seems to be my best attempt, I do not have a wide variety of wonderful shapes of Lego so the boat has turned out&nbsp;rather simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the photos added I tried to include&nbsp;as many interesting features as I&nbsp;could, for example: it has both a large front and back deck for the Lego guys to lounge on. I also ensured the&nbsp;roof could easily be moved for access to the cabin, this includes a galley, a small dining area and a place to sit. Beneath the deck at the back I also included a double bed bedroom with a small en-suite.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank&nbsp;you for reading and viewing, and please support my creation.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": [], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-13T19:15:57.000Z", "user": {"alias": "almanzo2000", "id": 1092018, "uuid": "c12db37f-ac4d-43bf-b87c-d7629d753aaa"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "14", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "33", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-13T19:15:57.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 13, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/357/9b5/144386/2503298-o_1al55ffesfv3qi198u14n1jjv7-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 10, "stats_views_count_short": "263"}, {"stats_days_left": 320.0536981083102, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:06.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/3f5/b42/144077/2499502-o_1akukfj7g191b14pl1qvfacu179rc-thumbnail-oq0dOdz3gWX2UA.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 103, "published_at": "2016-06-13T19:15:26.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 41, "stats_comments_count_short": "38", "id": 144077, "user_id": 1078387, "uuid": "367a3299-a604-47de-b2a0-ecc488cdb616", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Mini White Swan", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 354, "body": "<p align=\"left\">The Mini White Swan I made is really simple but functional.

These odd flat creatures, as the man explained, knew about left and right, back and forth, but didn&rsquo;t have a clue about up or down ... They did not know the third dimension, as we do. If one of them were to meet a three-dimensional being (an apple, say, who approached Flatland in a gesture of &quot;inter-dimensional amity&quot;), or if somehow the being pushed the flatlander from below and send him fluttering above the two dimensional world, the innocent flat creature would not understand anything. And afterwards, he would not know how to describe that mystical dimension called &quot;up&quot;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">And what about the fourth dimension? What about that place which is not left or right, front or back, up or down, but in another direction that we, normal people, cannot point at? Could we ever experience the same strange inter dimensional encounter, as the flatlander? </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">At that time I knew nothing about Science, but Carl Sagan&rsquo;s words fascinated me completely. And I have never forgotten that fascination. Carl Sagan&#39;s books occupy a place of honor in my library. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The set depicts the scene in which Carl talks about Flatland (a mathematical thought experiment designed by Edwin Abbott), which can be seen in <em>The Edge of Forever,</em> the original series 10</span><span lang=\"en-US\">th episode (</span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4TkVNGwvk)<span lang=\"en-US\">. It includes a figure of Carl, along the desk and the elements of the explanation: the plane, the colorful cutouts that represent the Flatlanders, the apples and the glass cubes which are used to think about a four-dimensional cube, also called a hyper-cube or tesseract.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">There is also a representation of the painting, &ldquo;Another world&rdquo;, by artist M.C. Escher, which is part of the original scene. I have to thank my wife Susan, who recognized the artist&#39;s work and helped me find it. This painting is very important, because it shows the paradox of seeing a landscape from different perspectives simultaneously. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Thank you for visiting and for reading! </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>&ldquo;<span lang=\"en-US\">Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were.

I recently decided to use Lego bricks as a medium to create what I call 3D murals: basically the front will look like a normal graffiti style mural with symbols, but when the model is rotated, the mural will come to life in 3D at the back, creating a very interesting visual art form. I foresee this medium to be good for many abstract sculptures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I have decided to do as a trial is the concept of the Underworld. There is a very characteristic red and white on black colour motif -- the first symbol is a flame, then a lesser known poplar tree which drips dew into the Lethe (inspired by Greek mythology) and then there is a characteristic red&nbsp;pitchfork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the model is rotated, the flame will come to life as a 3D fire with more details such as colour gradients. I particularly enjoyed doing the shadow gradients for the poplar tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me know what you guys think about such an art form and what other concepts I should do!

On top of the bridge are the unique side rails, and then there is a two lain road, and a small sidewalk on either side of the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Set contains Two male Minifigures, one female Minifigure, and one male coast guard Minifigure. The set also includes a bicycle, motorcycle, patrol boat with spotlight, and a car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you have seen the Lego Highway Bridge, it is up to you to make it a set! If you see my project, make sure to inform your friends, and to support it yourself!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["Lego", "Bridge", "Lego Bridge", "Red", "Black", "White", "Boat", "Minifigure", "Lego Minifigure", "Lifeguard", "Motorycle", "Car", "Bycicle", "Lego Car", "Road", "Highway", "Lines", "Water", "Lego Highway Bridge", "Lego Highway"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-13T07:28:51.000Z", "user": {"alias": "PKGUY", "id": 1076730, "uuid": "919bbb9c-9616-4106-80c3-56d7e3cc0e77"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "15", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "21", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-13T07:28:51.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 13, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/9a9/629/143581/2490281-o_1akharjkd2j01mqmihrc42q44n-full.jpg", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 25, "stats_views_count_short": "148"}, {"stats_days_left": 319.56220163331017, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:07.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/0e4/4b6/144200/2500923-o_1al1ilvgm1d1098g1hg119t21j87c-thumbnail-jvGtkpv8wGeBng.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 98, "published_at": "2016-06-13T07:27:41.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 30, "stats_comments_count_short": "60", "id": 144200, "user_id": 1009127, "uuid": "733fe2fe-c58d-4a99-9b3b-7a5c185bf57b", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "The Hobbit: Attack On Rhosgobel", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 525, "body": "<p>The Hobbit: Attack On Rhosgobel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hey there fellow builders!

In order to reach this great goal, he turned some animals from human world into his personal guards and soldiers-- <strong><em>Guardians of the Acheron</em></strong>.

I also made two claws with movable fingers. The sword can be attached to his leg and the cape can be attached to his back. These two parts are optional.

This set features 2 minifigures, a female settler and a male settler. It also features a baby (from the series 15 minifigures), 2 dogs, a rat,&nbsp;a horse, and 2 pigs (also from the series 15 minifigures). The&nbsp;features of this set include a water well with a bucket which can be lowered up and down by a simple mechanism, a veggie patch with a row of corn, cabbage, tomatoes, carrots, and a row which has been harvested. Other features include a log house which is furnished with a bed, a babies cot, some boxes with food, and a fire place which is where food is cooked. A pig pen is included which has opening gates, and a trough&nbsp;with food scraps (Lego food and pieces of course).

Gizmo is a very cute, happy and even tempered creature, but Gremlins are quite evil and&nbsp;wreak havoc wherever they go.

The interior is completely gone and is now filled with remainders of the roof. The house was origanally made with stone but as time passes on people started to repair the house with bricks. The door can&#39;t close completely due to the roof caving in, but it does move. This set contains a burnt out torch on the light grey wall. Over time the door broke, leaving only some glass and the bottom half. Minifigures can fit in the house and it is reasonably sized.

All the same, I like how it turned out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doors;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main reasons I didn&#39;t make a full version of the vehicle is the doors open upward, instead of old fashioned doors that open outward. Only the convertible version had doors like that, considering the fact that doors are connected to the top. Even without the top, this vehicle seems fine with old fashioned open out doors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wheels;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ughhhhh... doors. Okay, due to LDDs uneven organization, these wheels were hard&nbsp;to find. The actual tire and the wheels where all disorganized, and finding a pair that went together was a project on its own. I&#39;m not even sure if they will actually work as wheels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drivers department;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, that&#39;s a bad name, but I don&#39;t actually know what it&#39;s called.

The RTT featured here is a bit different then the real one.  Mine can fit less troops and has a slightly different design.  It still features a rotating twin light blaster cannon, cargo space, and prison cell that can slide into the main body.  The interior can also double as a cargo hold when prison cell is removed.  As shown in a picture above, the stormtroopers are able to be placed into the side holders, and not fall out due to the bricks that their feet can attach too.  A first ever Star Wars datapad and glow rod would be nice additions in the cargo box.  The pilot and gunner included are Imperial Army Troopers.  For those who do not know, Imperial Army Troopers and the Empire's main soldiers while Stormtroopers are the elite soldiers.  There is a SLD-26 planetary shield generator also featured in this set.  Sine the Rebel Hoth shield generator has been made I thought that the Imperial generator would be nice to include.  Attached to the shield generator is the ground defense.  The ground defense is completed with an E-web blaster cannon and a wall detailed with moss, dirt, and plants.  The scene gives it a more of a classic World War II machine gun defense feel.  To get more Lego EU characters and ones that are very popular I included one of the EU's most famous, Mara Jade Skywalker.  This Mara Jade is an Emperor's Hand edition with a magenta lightsaber.  Please help support an Expanded Universe set and get another iconic Star Wars character into Lego.

You move by rolling a 6 sided die (1d6) and land on opposing bricks to make them go to the out cast island (green space).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Conquer</em>-Get your king (rounded brick) to the opposite corner to win or if you jump on the other players king. If an opposing players piece is landed it&#39;s out of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Capture</em>-Same as conquer but if a piece gets jumped it just goes to the out cast island</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Kingdoms-</em>You have five actions a turn to destroy all the opposing kingdoms.

After a few modifications and relabeling it the Z8, the car was soon thereafter put into production and became an instant classic. &nbsp;BMW stopped making this&nbsp;car&nbsp;back in 2003 after building&nbsp;about 5,700 of them (including the Alpina), so you aren&#39;t going to see one very often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BMW offered only a very limited number of colors for the car. &nbsp;For the exterior, they produced silver, black, red, and blue, and eventually a darker metallic gray color. &nbsp;The interior could be ordered in black, red, red-black, tan, or tan-black. &nbsp;A BMW Individual version was eventually offered with more color choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with most sports cars, the Z8 with its nature-inspired curves&nbsp;poses a considerable challenge to reproduce faithfully in Lego. &nbsp;I have made an attempt here at 6 studs wide by ~20 studs long and ~5 studs high. &nbsp;The real vehicle is <span>72 in. wide,&nbsp;</span>173.2 in. long, and 51.9 in. high (ref: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z8\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z8</a>), so mine is a bit narrow (or long, if you prefer), due to limited part options. &nbsp;I implemented this model in silver (gray)&nbsp;with red interior. &nbsp;There was no suitable Lego color for the &quot;crema&quot; interior color BMW produced.&nbsp; Red and black exteriors also look good, but Lego does not produce a suitable shade of blue to match the blue exterior color of the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If done as a full-blown model, I would add stickers for the BMW blue-and-white rondel on the hood (bonnet)&nbsp;and trunk (boot), and do the front grille as a sticker with highbeam lamps on the ends, applied to a gray curved piece rather than a black one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henrik Fisker deserves a great deal of kudos for designing this beautiful automobile. &nbsp;I hope this model has done it justice.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["car", "sports car", "Z8", "BMW"], "state_entered_at": "2016-06-07T05:52:38.000Z", "user": {"alias": "TeraMedia", "id": 805367, "uuid": "1e12dab3-d2a5-40dc-9bd2-a0af2c4647ab"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "14", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "41", "support_ending_at": "2017-06-07T05:52:38.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jun 07, 2016", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/952/721/143376/2487496-o_1akc9lpb689pblm1gs21pco1pu4e-full.png", "state_id": 149, "stats_comments_count": 18, "stats_views_count_short": "445"}, {"stats_days_left": 313.49485794875, "updated_at": "2016-07-28T06:05:06.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/df6/0e8/143653/2491312-o_1akj9vqlh1k34ci1gd0ebqkl7-thumbnail-eRqEQR7jjUxkjA.png", "stats_supporters_count": 32, "published_at": "2016-06-07T05:50:44.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 13, "stats_comments_count_short": "11", "id": 143653, "user_id": 1018507, "uuid": "014a06d9-6ca7-470f-a721-1420fa7024c4", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Age of Empires", "state": {"name_short": "Gathering Support", "alias": "gathering_support"}, "stats_views_count": 254, "body": "<p>Age of Empires is one of the most loved computer video&nbsp;games and for me it was one of my favorites&nbsp;in my childhood&nbsp;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that, to combine&nbsp;&nbsp;Lego and Age of Empires is&nbsp;great, but not only because you can build from a little village or town to a big city &nbsp;or even your own empire.

And that is the place that The White Council met, and that is also what I have built today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This set will include 4 minifigures: &nbsp;Galdriel, Elrond, Gandalf and Saruman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Remember, this set will be the 1st&nbsp;of 3&nbsp;sets in Rivendell that I will create.

I decided to shrink it down a bit, and make it a bit more play friendly. The top comes off to reveal the inside, which can then hinge open. I removed the pillars and the kitchen area from it, mostly because they made it feel too cluttered and hard to play with. The table now has the little hologram of Leia where she gives the classic line &quot;Help me Obi-Wan-Kenobi.&quot; In addition the is some seating as seen in the film as well as some bottles and whatnot to one side. On the other side of the room is another table, presumably a dining table, and a small box which can open to reveal Luke&#39;s Lightsaber!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The set would probably include the four characters there at the time, Luke, Obi-Wan, C3-P0, and R2-D2. And of course no Tatooine set would be complete without a moisture vaporator. The piece count comes to about 300 including minifigures. I don&#39;t doubt that it could be lower it the build was optimized a bit better. Anyways, I hope you all like it and will help me by supporting and spreading this around via social media and whatnot.

This van can only sit one mini figure comfortably. On the grille there is a yellow 1x2 flat tile to represent the Chevy symbol. There are two opening doors one on each side of the van. Underneath the driver door and passenger door there are also yellow 1x2 flat tiles to also represent the Chevy logo.

It is capable of pumping 250 gallons of water per minute from a depth of almost 1,500 feet. The mine shaft from which the water was pumped was sited about 450 yards from the great wheel.

This would make an excellent set because as of now, there is no other like it! It would be a lot of fun to play with, not only because of the various different robots, but the several features of the tower. The hands which help manufacture the robots can move, and there is a hose up the side of the building for coolant liquid. The coolant liquid would get drained through the hatch that opens up when you pull a lever. Also, connected to the tower is the leash for the guard dog, Wilbur. Beneath the hands there are two reels which, when you pull out the blue piece stopping up the rope, can either give the Wilbur&nbsp;a longer, or shorter leash. Overall, it&#39;s a fun set that features a girl, something which we definitely should have more of.

I based my idea upon several different versions of the Batwing. I wanted to create a batwing that would fit the silhouette of the Batman symbol while still being a sleek jet. Mini-figure scaled, this massive 1400 piece ultimate Batwing is a great collectors piece, and has lots of playability. My inspiration for this idea was the 1989 Batman movie Batwing. I wanted to create a larger version, with a more modern feel to it. So I came up with this design, it took me several months to design and create, and i am finally happy with the design. I have always been a big fan of Batman&#39;s vehicles, i created an animated Batmobile a few months ago and decided to continue designing Bat-vehicles. This vehicle has several play and display features, the wings can be angled to preference, and the tail fins can be adjusted as well.&nbsp;This Batwing would look great as a display piece.
