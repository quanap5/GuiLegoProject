Little features include and turning ticket barrier, a smooth arena floor which the carts can move around easily and also the addition of a removable roof which makes playing with the set much easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think this would make a great playset for those that collect these sorts of models and younger children as they are most likely to love going to theme parks and going on rides like this and the abilities to play against family and friends with this set makes it a great set for families to enjoy together. Also, at 1022 pieces the set is not small and I would imagine to have a not so long, but fun building experience for the 1 person, parents and children or whoever it may be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This concludes my Lego Idea and I hope you like it and agreed with my description.

The model itself is built from less than&nbsp;300 pieces and, with the exception of a few Technic parts to attach the legs, it is all bricks, plates, slopes and tiles.&nbsp; It has movable legs, arms, hands and head. &nbsp;Its body can also easily disconnect from the legs,&nbsp;just like a regular minifigure. &nbsp;The legs can move from upright to seated (90 degrees movement forwards and 33 degrees movement backwards).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Concept</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To have a creative set, bucket or box that contains the pieces that would enable you to create a Jumbo minifigure&#39;s legs, body, arms and head with extra pieces to be able to create different shirt fronts and hats. &nbsp;For example LEGO set 10696 - Medium Creative Brick Box contains 484 pieces and I would expect that it would be possible to create a set of similar size and cost that would allow for my Jumbo minifigure model&nbsp;with left over pieces to create different shirt fronts, hats and possibly&nbsp;even tools or furniture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I originally made a Smurf (shown in other images) and my kids immediately fell in love with it. &nbsp;They would carry it around and pose it, but I had a problem with the leg attachment because it wasn&#39;t strong and the legs would detach or the body would&nbsp;fall because of its weight. &nbsp;So I spent a lot of time working on that, trying to&nbsp;<span>get them&nbsp;just right, with the right amount of clearance to move the legs and the right amount of friction to enable the model to stand up and support the weight of the body&nbsp;and hea</span><span>d.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that it is sturdy enough the kids&nbsp;want&nbsp;to build their own but while we have a lot of LEGO, finding the right quantities in the right colours can be difficult and I thought that it would be great to be able to simply buy the model. &nbsp;We recently purchase a large brick box which has tons of bricks in it, just not quite the right ones. &nbsp;So I thought that maybe it would be a good idea to submit this project to LEGO ideas.&nbsp;This&nbsp;got me thinking about coming a with a more refined design that would make it good for kids with the ability to get creative and use their imaginations a little&nbsp;and&nbsp;I came up with the idea of a model that makes it fairly easy to change the shirt front design and potentially the face&nbsp;also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from my other images I have come up with a few simple designs in LEGO Digital Designer which&nbsp;makes it really easy to try different things out and create nice images. &nbsp;It shows how easily you can redesign the model. &nbsp;It could be a lot of fun trying to recreate a scale model of your favourite minifigures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another&nbsp;cool thing about the size and scale of this model is that it makes it really easy to use 2x2 bricks to build things to scale with. &nbsp;So if you have boxes of regular bricks it is easy to make tables, chairs and other furniture and utensils that scale well to suit this model, without being so large that you need too many bricks to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not really sure which specific shirt style and hat is the best, but I am also not certain that this is an important part of the concept, at least at this point. &nbsp;LEGO will know which themes are the most popular and if my idea manages to make it that far it would be easy for them to work out what they think would work well, but feedback from the LEGO community would also help. &nbsp;The Fireman/Police man pair has the least differences between the two models. But I feel like having a bunch of 1x1 and 2x1 plates of varying colours to enable you to design your own shirt fronts would be the best way to go. &nbsp;The whole idea here is to have the right pieces to get the base model correctly, then you can integrate with other LEGO&nbsp;that you already have to come up with new designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make your own</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you like my design and are inspired to&nbsp;make one for yourself. &nbsp;If you have kids then make one with them, I am sure they will love it as much as my kids do. &nbsp;My daughter has tea parties with the Smurf! &nbsp;I would love to see what designs you can come up with. &nbsp;I would especially love to see how you would model characters from all of the LEGO minifigure series so far. &nbsp;For me hair is the challenge, I just can&#39;t work it out, but I am sure there are plenty out there that could. &nbsp;For kids it doesn&#39;t have to be complicated though which is why I feel my design would work well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if my model doesn&#39;t make it all the way to the top, it would be great to start a Jumbo minifigure trend! &nbsp;Thanks for reading.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["jumbo", "minifigure", "minifigure scale", "creator", "creative", "model"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-06T14:20:01.000Z", "user": {"alias": "jenakai", "id": 885699, "uuid": "9a81839a-5a1b-4767-a70f-8f991beb3ba9"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "9", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "61", "support_ending_at": "2016-07-06T14:17:50.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 07, 2015", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/1f1/a34/107905/1979400-o_19pbefiru8c7ln712jqem2sbkc-full.png", "state_id": 154, "stats_comments_count": 21, "stats_views_count_short": "1k"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-07T06:03:13.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/19f/079/107865/1978670-o_19pag7aa0a1o1k44hm1s4hiqn7-thumbnail-6FXy-0EwfST3ew.png", "stats_supporters_count": 11, "published_at": "2015-07-07T14:12:17.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 4, "stats_comments_count_short": "4", "id": 107865, "user_id": 640195, "uuid": "b927c91f-e5b1-41cd-ac97-9a0a2260b9a3", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Camp Wanoxett", "state": {"name_short": "Expired", "alias": "expired"}, "stats_views_count": 615, "body": "<p>Camp Wanoxett sure to shine on!

Holmes was&nbsp;put in the Guinness world records for the &quot;most portrayed movie actor&quot; .&nbsp;From the 1922 silent film to the 1996 Jeremy Brett series (my favorite).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a great modular set for that fan (or beginner fan)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dimension of Sherlock Holmes are as follows&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Height 22cm (9inch)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And the dimensions of Dr.Watson are&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Height 20cm (8inch)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for your time, and I&nbsp;would love see to this as a set ,so&nbsp;please if you would,&nbsp;support this project.</p>\r\n", "user_comments_locked": false, "tags": ["sherlock holmes", "watson", "221b baker street", "mystery"], "state_entered_at": "2016-07-06T14:20:01.000Z", "user": {"alias": "redtiger122", "id": 880333, "uuid": "39093b7b-213f-4fc2-a46e-916ba7d126e4"}, "product_image_url": null, "stats_followers_count_short": "7", "price_usd": null, "product_id": null, "stats_supporters_count_short": "20", "support_ending_at": "2016-07-06T14:11:21.000Z", "product_description": null, "published_at_formatted": "Jul 07, 2015", "image_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/9ac/e77/107877/1978768-o_19panbr9ca871rq41e7f4k511g67-full.jpg", "state_id": 154, "stats_comments_count": 14, "stats_views_count_short": "1k"}, {"stats_days_left": 0, "updated_at": "2016-07-07T06:03:13.000Z", "image_tile_url": "https://dp1eoqdp1qht7.cloudfront.net/community/projects/b70/761/107848/1978388-o_19pabd3emr0rjvlajek6u142t7-thumbnail-qCjbFk5q25-EwQ.jpg", "stats_supporters_count": 481, "published_at": "2015-07-07T13:04:52.000Z", "sold_out": null, "stats_followers_count": 114, "stats_comments_count_short": "123", "id": 107848, "user_id": 877044, "uuid": "16cac069-23de-4c14-a8c4-a86f469e9abf", "product_image_tile_url": null, "title": "Cameras", "state": {"name_short": "Expired", "alias": "expired"}, "stats_views_count": 3121, "body": "<p>This is a&nbsp;set of 2 analogue style cameras which build to be life sized and remain 100% made from existing lego pieces.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The designs have been inspired by the retro style of analogue cameras for a more classic look and also because larger vintage style cameras have a more satisfying feel to hold in your hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea with this project was to create something a bit more unique and to make something that would be fun to be build for any level of lego experience.
